    "input": "By . Dan Bloom . The square where Ukraine's national crisis began has erupted into violence again as the few hundred remaining protesters clashed with riot police. Black smoke billowed from burning tyres and activists threw stones in Kiev's Independence Square today as officials tried to remove barricades which had remained since President\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February. The violence came as Nato warned Russia could be planning to invade the east of the country as it once again massed 20,000 troops on the border. Scroll down for video . Erupting into violence again: Smoke rose once more today from Independence Square in Kiev, the same place which saw the pro-European protests which toppled Ukraine's President Viktor\u00a0Yanukovych in February . The protestors - who said they were remaining on their barricades to ensure the government did not row back on promises of reform - threw missiles and set alight to heaps of tyres as authorities tried to remove them . All walks of life: Even an Orthodox priest got involved, clashing with the government's Kiev-1 volunteer battalion . Confusion: The riot police and workers eventually withdrew - leaving the situation unresolved in chaotic scenes . Activists - including an Orthodox priest - threw bottles and paving bricks at municipal workers who had been dispatched to dismantle the tents and barricades in the square this morning. Armed riot police moved onto the square to fight club-waving protesters in combat clothes and masks. The riot police and workers eventually withdrew - leaving the situation unresolved in chaotic scenes. The square, known as the Maidan after its name in Ukrainian, was the focus of pro-European protests which ignited Ukraine's political crisis at the end of last year. Pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown and replaced by the more pro-European\u00a0Petro Poroshenko, largely thanks to the violent protests. Bloody: There were injuries between the self-defence activists (pictured) and government volunteers . Clashes: The eyes of the world had since shifted from Kiev to pro-Russian rebels in the east of Ukraine . Violence: At one point there were thousands of protesters in the square, but now only a few hundred remain . Historic: The square is in the centre of Kiev and has been crucial to the country's political crisis . But that sparked the anti-Kiev feeling among pro-Russians in eastern Ukraine, spiralling into a civil war and the takeover of cities like Donetsk and Luhansk by militants. Many protesters, including self-defence militias, had taken down their tents and returned to their homes since Poroshenko was elected in May. Other barricades remained in place along with makeshift shrines to the 100 or so protesters killed by police sniper fire during the protests. A few hundred protesters are estimated to still be in the square, saying they wanted to ensure the new government kept its promises of reform. But Kiev's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely ahead of an expected parliamentary election at the end of October. Anger: The clashes were sparked when city employees tried to clear remaining tents from the square . Yury Kovalchuk, a 43-year-old businessman, complained: 'There are practically no normal people left' Makeshift: The barricades in Independence Square, known as Maidan, have been up for several months . Improvised armour: An activist in a camouflage jacket, a cycle helmet and novelty lab goggles looks on . They had already tried to negotiate with the stragglers but all attempts to forge a deal fell through. 'It's like seeing everything that went on in winter coming back: tyres are burning, the police are here and so are people with clubs,' said Vitaly Lyakh, a 37-year-old Kiev resident. 'It's not right - especially since the most decent people have gone off to fight in the war (against separatists in the east). Civilised countries don't behave like this'. One protester wearing a Ukrainian cossack uniform, Mykola Bondar, declared his resistance to attempts to take down the encampment. A group of young masked protesters stood nearby atop a truck, banging on the roof of the vehicle with clubs. 'They tried to kill us today. They set fire to us,' he said. Explosives: An activist in the square throws a Molotov cocktail today at a burning tyre barricade . Improvised: The protesters built up everything they could as their defences, including large outdoor bins . Battle: Kiev's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely . Chaos: Just as the clashed happened in Kiev, Russia was mounting troops along the eastern border . But\u00a0Yury Kovalchuk, a 43-year-old businessman, said: 'It's the right thing to do. 'I was here from the start of the Maidan and I believe it's right now to take down what there is here. There are practically no normal people left here.' Hundreds of miles away in the east, fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels has continued - leaving crash investigators unable to attend the scene of the MH17 disaster. And\u00a0Russia announced more military exercises near the border this week, prompting a warning from Nato that the Kremlin could be planning a ground invasion. Nato officials warned Moscow had 20,000 troops near the border who could move into Ukraine under the pretext of launching a humanitarian mission. Putin has rallied Russians with relentless nationalist campaigns in state media against Ukraine and in support of the rebel cause, and Western officials fear he might invade to prevent a rebel defeat. National crisis: An activist throws a stone today during the clashes in Kiev's Independence Square . Shirtless: Unlike during the bitter protests in winter, summer temperatures in Kiev have hovered around 30C . Unprotected: Most of the demonstrators had no body armour, despite throwing Molotov cocktails .",

    "input": "A contestant on the Vietnamese version of MasterChef caused outrage when she punched the belly of a live turtle and then beheaded it with a large cleaver. Hundreds of appalled viewers complained when Khanh Phuong, 21, was shown hacking at the turtle's head which was peaking out of its shell. The contestant first used a wooden stick but after losing patience and thumping the belly of the turtle with her fist, then used a pair of scissors and a knife to force the bloodied head out. Then, pinning the roof of its mouth to a wooden chopping board with a blade, Miss Phuong screamed as she sliced its head off with a large cleaver. Scroll down for video . Contestant Khanh Phuong hacks the head off a turtle with a large cleaver during the controversial episode . Following the graphic episode, there was a backlash from shocked viewers in Vietnam, with 70 per cent saying in an online poll they should not have been broadcast. Miss Phuong also said she was embarrassed when viewing the scene and said she had killed the turtle in a 'very cruel' way. She also said she 'could not sleep well' since beheading the animal. In the episode broadcast on VTV3, the contestants were challenged to prepare a meal using live animals, including two kinds of fish and a turtle. Miss Phuong has expressed regret for what happened and says she is embarrassed by the 'very cruel' killing . The MasterChef Vietnam spin-off is now in its second series and the show is broadcast on VTV3 . The boss of the TV channel revealed it had been 'an accident' to show the footage and was 'stupefied' after it was aired. Lai Van Sam said: 'Allowing such a violent scene to air was an accident. Sometimes we have to watch too many programmes a day and only inattention causes us to miss such scenes. 'We stood there stupefied after it was broadcast.' Chef and judge on the show Tuan Hai (far right) defended the beheading saying it was a situation that every chef had to deal with . In\u00a0July 2014, Masterchef Australia made international headlines when it displayed the Indian flag upside down.\u00a0In the episode, contestants had to prepare dishes from different national cuisines. But when the Indian flag was revealed from underneath a silver dish-cover the flag was upside down, with the saffron segment at the bottom and the green at the top. In August 2013, it was reported that the UK'S MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace punched a man five times at a dinner he was hosting at the Wood Norton Hotel in Worcestershire for allegedly touching his girlfriend. Josh Marks, a 7'2\" tall basketball player and runner-up on season three of US MasterChef was arrested in July 2013 after a bizarre confrontation with University of Chicago police in which he told officers he'd been possessed by Gordon Ramsay who turned him into God. But chef Tuan Hai, a judge on the show, said it was a situation every chef had to deal with. 'The image was related to and is part of the story. Dealing with live animals involves situations that every cook must overcome. 'Watching such scenes, viewers can find out more about the candidate\u2019s character.' The MasterChef format, which is franchised around the world, is based on the UK original, but is down to production companies in each country to decide on content. It is in its second series in Vietnam and the controversial episode was broadcast on September 20. The Shine Group, which licences the show worldwide, said: 'We work closely with each licensee of the MasterChef format globally outside of the UK. 'Though what is considered acceptable to eat, and how it is prepared, can vary greatly in different countries' cultures, we strongly discourage tasks which feature the preparation of live animals. 'Unfortunately the production company in Vietnam made us aware of the item only after it had been aired. It was clearly an unacceptable and regrettable incident.'",

    "input": "Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- \"I'm a big history buff,\" President Obama said in an interview with ABC News\" George Stephanopoulos. \"And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of.\" I am sometimes asked the same question that Mr. Stephanopoulos put to President Obama: Why study Confederate history? And I agree with the president's response. As we approach the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, we look back to its centennial in the 1960s. A lot has happened in this country since then, and our appreciation of the lessons of history has changed with the times. One constant has been the importance of the Civil War. It remains as the most important era of American history, a time when America withstood its biggest challenges to a constitutional democracy which then was still viewed as an experiment in a new form of government. The crucible of war defined the nation as we know it today, as we became \"indivisible\" and \"with liberty and justice for all\" for the first time. During the 1960s, we Americans looked at the war as it occurred on the battlefields, because the conduct and course of the war dominated every single moment of every day. And the Confederate soldiers have historically captured our fascination even more than the Union soldiers. Perhaps it is the gallantry and dash of leaders like Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson or J.E.B. Stuart. Or perhaps it was the common enlisted men in the Confederate ranks, whose valor and courage -- in the face of tremendous privation and against overwhelming odds -- makes them stand out in world history as one of the best bodies of soldiers ever known. Another perspective on the Confederacy and history . If the fascination with soldiers continues from the 1960s to today, what has changed? Today, the study of Confederate history is much more \"inclusive\" -- to use the word of choice for many state's 150th anniversary commissions -- as we look more deeply into the past. Today we ask different questions of history and I think we get better answers. Let me list just a few of those questions. What about slavery? We did not talk much about it in the 1960s. Today, we cannot study the Confederacy without studying 40 percent of its population. So now we look long and hard at this aspect of American history, including its existence and importance in the North. We see so clearly today that it was a wrong, so we need to ask why so many people 150 years ago did not see it as wrong and why several of the important Christian denominations split apart over this issue before the country itself split. What about the slaves themselves? Why did many take advantage of the first opportunity to escape to freedom while others remained \"loyal\" to the South? And what about the 400,000 African-Americans in the South who were free long before Abraham Lincoln came on the scene? iReporter: Civil War history could have been \"teachable moment\" What about the Southerners who remained loyal to the Union and chose to fight in blue, rather than gray? What about the thousands of immigrants who \"escaped\" the wars of Europe yet enlisted in both armies to demonstrate their loyalty to their new country? At the opposite end of the spectrum, what about the Native Americans who had been here long before any Europeans, yet allied with the Confederacy? The last Confederate brigade to surrender was composed entirely of Native Americans and commanded by Brigadier General Stand Watie, a full-blooded Cherokee. What about the very important Jewish community in the South? Many served in the ranks while others saw civilian service, such as Judah Benjamin, who had three different Cabinet posts, or Phoebe Pember, who became the head nurse at Chimborazo, the biggest hospital in the world. And what about the women of the South? The war thrust them into new positions of responsibility and many continued after the war to lead public enterprises that engendered self-esteem and respect. We Americans -- from native Americans to those who have ancestors who wore the blue or gray to those who are descended from slaves to those who have recently come to our shores -- want to know ourselves. We want to understand why our country is different from the others around the world. This is why millions of Americans read so many books about the Civil War or visit the battlefields or come to museums like The Museum of the Confederacy so that they can see first hand the ingredients that formed us. And this is why so many foreigners come to America to visit those same sites in order to understand why we are who we are. The fact is that we must know the Civil War if we are to know America. And to know the Civil War, we must know and understand the Confederacy -- in all of its diversity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S. Waite Rawls III.",

    "input": "Britain's biggest offshore wind farm with turbines up to 650ft high will dwarf views of the Isle of Wight, the United Nations has warned. Nearly 200 towers, spanning an area larger than Manchester, are proposed just nine miles off Dorset\u2019s unique Jurassic Coast. But in an explosive letter to the Government, the UN\u2019s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) has said the project would significantly affect the coastline and could threaten its status as England\u2019s only natural World Heritage Site. Unesco insists that the \u00a33.5\u2009billion French-Dutch Navitus Bay development \u2013 with up to 194 turbines, each the height of London\u2019s \u2018Gherkin\u2019 building \u2013 will \u2018dominate\u2019 the area and change the seascape for ever. Local opponents to the plan say it will devastate tourism in the area. Unesco director Kishore Rao wrote to the Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) which is responsible for managing the World Heritage site along 95 miles of the stunning Dorset and Devon coastline. Earlier this year, DCMS claimed to Unesco that the Government-backed wind farm would have little impact on the Jurassic Coast. But Unesco has commissioned its own advisory study and in a strongly worded letter seen by the Mail on Sunday, Mr Rao said it \u2018considers the project will have a significant impact on the natural setting of the property (the Jurassic Coast), in that it would adversely impact on important views\u2019. Nearly 200 towers, spanning an area larger than Manchester, are proposed just nine miles off Dorset's unique Jurassic Coast . He went on: \u2018The project would replace the Isle of Wight as the dominant feature on the horizon. 'This is likely to significantly impact on visitors\u2019 experience and appreciation of the property which could compromise the long-term sustainability of the management of the property. \u2018Any potential impacts on this natural property are in contradiction to the overarching principle of the World Heritage Convention... The property will change from being located in a natural setting largely free from human-made structures to one dominated by human-made structures.\u2019 Should the proposal be given the go-ahead, the developers expect the first turbines to come online in 2019 and provide power for 700,000 homes. Dr Andrew Langley, of opposition group Challenge Navitus, said: \u2018The Navitus Bay wind farm would completely change the character of views from Durlston Castle near Swanage. \u2018The decision by the Crown Estate in 2009 to designate this zone so close to England\u2019s only natural World Heritage Site, two areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a national park, was extremely surprising.\u2019 Impact assessments carried out by Navitus Bay itself found that up to a third of visitors could be deterred from holidaying in the area during the construction phase. And once the wind farm is in operation, 14 per cent of visitors said the loss of view would prevent them from returning. Bournemouth council\u2019s head of tourism Mark Smith said that could mean thousands of people losing their jobs. \u2018We\u2019re very concerned. If the figures that Navitus is using are right, it would devastate tourism and result in massive unemployment,\u2019 he added. Last night, Mike Unsworth, project director at Navitus Bay, said: \u2018We are aware of the letter from Unesco\u00a0 to the DCMS. 'We will be seeking\u00a0 further clarification as the interim comments are not aligned with the independent impact assessment or the conclusion of DCMS.\u2019",

    "input": "By . James Rush . and Amanda Williams . John Garner was discovered last week off the coast of St Vincent floating in the water wearing a life jacket, around 200 feet away from his yacht . A British sailor found seriously injured close to his burning yacht in the Caribbean died from injuries consistent with an explosion, police have said. Officers on the island of St Vincent had launched a murder investigation following the death of John Garner, 53, and described his girlfriend as a 'person of interest'. However, following the results of the post-mortem they said they no longer wanted to question her, the Associated Press has reported. Mr Garner was discovered last week off the coast of St Vincent floating in the water wearing a life jacket, around 200 feet away from his yacht. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Police said he was alone on board the boat during the apparent explosion and that his Norwegian girlfriend had left the island a couple of days earlier. Sailing experts have said it is not uncommon for people to die from propane stove explosions. Diving instructor Kay Wilson who discovered Mr Garner, said there was so much black smoke that by the time she reached the stricken boat it had already been engulfed by flames. She said: 'It was almost razed to the water line, and the heat and the smoke which were coming were just incredible.' The vessel was 'almost underwater' and it looked like Mr Garner had tried to deploy his life raft but it did not deploy properly, she said. Ms Wilson added: 'Behind the boat there was debris in every direction and the wind was carrying the debris from the boat. 'I think it was an indication there had been an explosion on board because there was so much stuff in the water - garbage from the galley and small pieces of debris. 'We found him (Mr Garner) very close relatively to his yacht, probably about 150-200 feet downwind, floating in the water. A local TV station posted this picture believed to be of the yacht on fire off the coast of St Vincent . 'He was wearing a lifejacket that inflates when you hit the water. It had inflated and was holding him up.' Mr Garner is believed to have been spending time on the Grenadines island of Bequia with another family member and planned to make his way to Antigua. The yacht is reportedly named Asante and registered in Gibraltar. A . sailing friend in Norway, where Mr Garner has lived for many years, said . the grandfather was ultra-fit and previously worked as a . physical trainer for British special forces. The . friend said on Thursday: \u2018It is very shocking news. He was a very nice . man. He loved his yacht, Asante, and he was meticulous about the way he . kept it. He had a military attitude towards things and was a strict . sailing instructor. Diving instructor Kay Wilson (pictured here on Skype) has said she believes Mr Garner's death was an accident . \u2018He . is what you would call an English gentleman. He trained the special . forces in Britain, the SAS I believe, although he was a civilian and did . not have a rank.' The friend said they had previously spoken about the dangers of travelling to St Vincent. Mr Garner's yacht, Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the coast of St. Vincent . \u2018Me . and John spoke about St Vincent many times. In the yachting society, St . Vincent is somewhere you sailed straight past and did not stop at. \u2018It was not a safe place, it was a place to avoid. People were worried about thefts and robberies and rapes. \u2018Boat . boys would try to help you to anchor, when you did not need help, and . then charge you money. You paid them because you feared they would come . back at night time. \u2018I told John this but he would say that it was okay and that he did not have a problem with them.' On Wednesday, pictures emerged of the burning boat, with plumes of black smoke billowing out. The . yacht, called Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off . the beautiful coastal resort of Buccament, south-west of the island, . which boasts several five-star hotels. Mr Garner had previously advertised sailing trips around the British Virgin Islands for between \u00a35,500 and \u00a39,000. The . online advertisement offers a journey around a \u2018beautiful area\u2019 and . lessons in navigation, boat handling and overboard practice, among other . skills. It states: \u2018The instructor of Asante, John Edward Garner is Norwegian / English and he is also the owner of the boat. The Asante was described as 'a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty' with four sleeping cabin . \u2018Skipper . and instructor John at Asante is a graduate of the English Yachtmaster . system and Yachtmaster Ocean from England, and has sailed far.\u2019 The boat is described as \u2018a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty\u2019 with four sleeping cabins.

    "input": "The UN's World Health Organisation has come out with the firm recommendation that we should all be aiming to cut our sugar intake by half . On paper, you would think it had been a good week for those with serious concerns about the amounts of sugar that so many of us are consuming. On Wednesday, for instance, no less an authority than the UN\u2019s World Health Organisation came out with the firm recommendation that we should all be aiming to cut our sugar intake by half and that children should not be given fizzy drinks at all. That came just one day after Dame Sally Davies, the Government\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, proposed that a sugar tax needed to be introduced if we wanted to cut sugar intake and reduce obesity. And it came on the same day that an eminent New York cardiovascular research scientist warned that the long-running demonisation of fats, and saturated fats in particular, could be entirely misplaced. The real killer, according to Dr James DaNicolantio, particularly when it comes to heart disease and Type 2 diabetes \u2014 those two scourges of the modern age \u2014 is sugar. After these three dramatic interventions, surely it is game, set and match for those of us who would like to see sugar consumption seriously reduced? Well, as a cardiologist and science director of the campaigning health group, Action On Sugar, I can tell you that we\u2019re certainly not dancing in the streets just yet. For despite the mounting evidence of the damage to health done by sugar \u2014 evidence that many working in the field would now describe as overwhelming \u2014 this was the response from the Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman on Wednesday: \u2018What we are doing is working with the industry. You have already seen commitments from retailers and food manufacturers to reduce levels of salt, to remove some artificial fats, to reduce calorie content and improve labelling.\u2019 It\u2019s the first sentence \u2014 \u2018what we are doing is working with the industry\u2019 \u2014 that gives the game away because it\u2019s absolutely true. The links between Government ministers and food manufacturers, and indeed between scientists who are supposed to advise the Government and the food manufacturers, are nothing short of astonishing. For these are the same food manufacturers who have been adding extra sugar to processed foods, confectionery and fizzy drinks for decades. The London Olympic Games, the biggest celebration of fitness and health in this country for decades, was sponsored by Coca-Cola and McDonald's . It is the closeness of those links that are widely blamed for a compulsory food traffic-light system \u2014 an idea once enthusiastically championed by the Food Standards Agency and designed to give shoppers an idea of the nutritional value (or not) of the item they were about to buy \u2014 quietly dying a death soon after the Coalition came to power. But then what do we expect when the London Olympic Games, the biggest celebration of fitness and health in this country for decades, was sponsored by Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s? And what do we expect when, as this newspaper revealed only last month, fast-food companies, supermarkets and restaurant chains have had dozens of meetings with ministers since the last election? Nando\u2019s, Tesco, Pepsi, Mars and, almost inevitably, the ubiquitous McDonald\u2019s are among those who have had the chance to bend the ministerial ear since 2010. Government ministers hate their close links to the food industry being exposed by the media. But these links exist and are one reason, I believe, for the Government\u2019s lax approach. Too often, when a minister pronounces on dietary matters, I wonder whether he is just saying what his chums in the food industry have told him to say. Meanwhile, rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer \u2014 all conditions with increasingly strong links to sugar intake \u2014 continue to rise. Influential organisations such as the British Nutrition Foundation have a membership that reads like the Who's Who of the sugar industry - Coca-Cola and Pepsi among them . The Food and Drink Federation, the industry lobby group, for instance, has had 16 meeting with ministers since the last election and an astonishing 99 with Government officials. By contrast, we in Action On Sugar have had just one, although a second, we\u2019re told, is in the pipeline. There\u2019s no way of knowing who has met whom, but there is also no hiding the conflicts of interest. Bill Morgan, special adviser to former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, for instance, came from a PR firm that has Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods and Tesco on its books, although the PR company has always denied that Mr Morgan worked on two of those accounts. But its website did highlight his potential for linking the interests of its clients with Government policy. Even Mr Lansley, himself, architect of the Government\u2019s \u2018Responsibility Deal\u2019, which effectively handed responsibility for the levels of fats, salt and sugar in food to the food manufacturers themselves, has past links with the industry. In 2009, while still Shadow Health Secretary, he was director of a marketing firm where clients included Pepsi, Mars, Pizza Hut and Diageo\u2019s Guinness. Earlier this year, Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches programme revealed that five of the eight members of the Government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Committee of Nutrition (SACN) received substantial funding from large confectionary companies. The real killer, according to Dr James DaNicolantio, particularly when it comes to heart disease and Type 2 diabetes - those two scourges of the modern age - is sugar . These included the committee\u2019s chairman, Professor Ian Macdonald, who receives money not only from Unilever, the world\u2019s biggest ice-cream maker, but also from Coca-Cola and Mars. His committee colleague, Professor Tom Sanders, one of the Government\u2019s most trusted advisers when it comes to diet, sugar and heart disease, has had his research funded to the tune of \u00a34.5\u2009million by the sugar giant Tate & Lyle. There is, of course, no evidence \u2014 or indeed, any suggestion \u2014 that members of the SACN have ever put the interests of the companies that sponsor them first. But the committee has gone against prevailing scientific opinion as rates of obesity and diet-related diabetes have grown and its reports are said to be one of the main reasons why official health advice on the amounts of sugar we eat haven\u2019t changed in 11 years. The WHO is absolutely right, we must cut down on our consumption of dietary sugar . This advice suggests that an individual can consume a staggering 22 teaspoons of sugar a day as part of a guideline daily amount. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation suggested that figure should be just six teaspoons. The difference is huge and, in the face of the dramatic intervention by the WHO, I wonder if the SACN\u2019s committee\u2019s recommendations will suddenly be changing now? On Wednesday, I was due to go on Channel 4 News to discuss the WHO\u2019s new recommendations but the debate was cancelled when the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) withdrew, apparently after discovering that I would be up against them. Had they turned up, I might have pointed out that the relentless drive for profit among food companies had contributed to unnecessary suffering for millions of people and thousands of deaths that might otherwise have been prevented. Moreover, there is growing evidence that not all calories are the same (contrary to what the food companies will tell you). Research from Stanford University last year showed that for every 150 sugar calories (from a can of Coke, for example) consumed above the recommended daily calorie intake, there is an 11-fold increase in the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes compared with 150 \u2018excess\u2019 calories consumed from a non-sugar source. That increase is completely independent of body weight and levels of exercise: in other words, we are all vulnerable. Yet still the Government does nothing. And as long as influential organisations such as the British Nutrition Foundation have a membership that reads like the Who\u2019s Who of the sugar industry \u2014 Coca-Cola, Kellogg\u2019s McDonald\u2019s, Nestle and Pepsi among them \u2014 and the British Dietetic Association can promote an Eat Well plate that includes a full-sugar can of cola and fruit juice as part of a balanced diet, I fear that won\u2019t change. But change it must, for our health, and particularly the health of our children, depends upon it. The WHO is absolutely right, we must cut down on our consumption of dietary sugar and it\u2019s high-time the Government cast aside its cosy relationship with the food industry, faced up to the unpalatable scientific facts and did the right thing.",

Flintoff\u2019s extraordinary comeback, which started with Lancashire last season and extended to the Brisbane Heat Big Bash team, now includes him putting in an appearance at England\u2019s practice ahead of their tri-series game against India. Before anyone gets too carried away it should be stressed that Flintoff has been asked to join the England team by coach Peter Moores not to bowl but to chat to the younger players and allow them to pick his brains. Andrew Flintoff, pictured playing for the Brisbane Heat, will join England for a practice session on Sunday . Flintoff bays during the Big Bash League match between the Heat and Perth Scorchers . Flintoff remains one of the best death-ball bowlers in international one-day cricket over the last 20 years . It is felt that Flintoff, who has hinted that his comeback will come to an end after the Big Bash is concluded next week, will be a positive presence for a young England team still rebuilding after the upheaval of the last year. It is unclear whether Flintoff, who has struggled to make an impression with Brisbane, was going to take part in training but he remains one of the best death bowlers in one-day cricket of the last 20 years and could surely pass on a tip or two. The appearance of one of the legends of the 2005 Ashes series would give England a boost after their defeat in the tri-series opener against Australia and with them now desperately needing to beat India at the Gabba on Tuesday. Ian Bell (left) walks off after being dismissed during England's opening tri-series loss to Australia . They received another setback yesterday when it was revealed that Gary Ballance broke the little finger of his right hand during fielding practice in Canberra ahead of the tri-series against Australia and India. While it must be considered unfortunate that a player who has not featured in the first three games of this tour should pick up an injury England will not replace Ballance even though he is unlikely to be fit for the rest of the tri-series. England are confident that their reserve batsman will be fit for the World Cup so will give James Taylor every chance to cement his place at No3 rather than rush in a replacement player just for the last three matches of this series. Flintoff holds the 2005 Ashes aloft following the Oval Test match after the famous series . Eoin Morgan, England's one-day captain, top scored during the loss to Australia with 121 runs . Someone who still maintains he would welcome a call-up, unlikely though it is, is Kevin Pietersen, who yesterday became the highest scorer in the Australian Twenty20 competition this season when he hit 67 from 42 balls In Melbourne Stars victory over Sydney Thunder. Yet there was no rush here to call in Pietersen to a net session as Moores and Stuart Broad, who extended the invitation, have done with Flintoff. Meanwhile Yorkshire, the county champions, face a battle to keep hold of their highly rated coach Jason Gillespie as it emerged that South Australia want to take the former Australia fast bowler home to Adelaide. Gillespie has been an outstanding success at Headingley and is settled in Leeds with his family but will face a severe test of his loyalty to his adopted county if South Australia follow up their interest with a firm offer.

The 45-year-old is stable but remains in a coma at the Grenoble hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury. Schumacher is a formidable figure in F1, winning a record seven world titles, and his plight has attracted global interest and an outpouring of support from the sport's fans. However his family wants the media to keep their distance. \"Please support us in our common fight with Michael,\" Corinna Schumacher, wife of the F1 racer, said in a statement. \"It is important to me that you [media] relieve the doctors and the hospital so that they can work in peace. \"I kindly ask you to trust their statements and leave the clinic. Please also let our family in peace.\" Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December. The German hit a rock hidden under deep snow and was catapulted head first onto another rock. He was not moving fast at the time. He is in a medically induced coma and has undergone two operations. His condition has attracted intense media scrutiny and last week a journalist disguised as a priest tried to sneak into the French hospital room where the Formula One superstar is being treated. The doctors at the hospital have also called for the media to provide more respect. \"The privacy of the patient demands that we are not going into details of his treatment, and this is why we do not plan any press conferences, nor give out written press releases, anymore for the time being,\" they said in a statement on Monday . \"We again insistently ask you to respect the medical secrets and to stick to the information given by the medical team in charge of the patient or his management, as this is the only valid information. \"The clinical state of Michael Schumacher is considered as stable and is constantly monitored by the medical treatments that are administered to him. \"However, the medical team responsible underlines that they will not stop to consider Michael's condition as critical.\" Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm added: \"I can confirm Michael's condition can be considered as stable, as written in the official statement. I cannot confirm to have stated that his life is out of danger.\" French prosecutors will reportedly brief journalists on their investigation into Schumacher's accident on Wednesday in the Alpine town of Albertville. Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history, driving for the Benetton and Ferrari teams and winning a record seven world titles and 91 grand prix wins.",

The founder of the organization that built Colorado's largest mosque is offering to bury suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a Denver-area Muslim cemetery. Sheikh Abu-Omar Al-mubarac said he will pay for a traditional Muslim burial - no headstone, monument or casket - at a plot at a Muslim cemetery in Denver or Bennett. Al-mubarac refused to say which one out of concern for 'undue publicity.' He says he'll bury Tsarnaev as long as his family can get the body to Denver. Scroll down for videos... Offer: Sheikh Abu-Omar Almubarac who founded the Colorado Muslim Society and the states largest mosque has offered to bury the body of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev . Al-mubarac incorporated the Colorado Muslim Society in the late 1960s but made his offer independently of the organization. Al-mubarac says only God can judge Tsarnaev. However, the Colorado Muslim Society issued a statement on Monday night distancing itself from its founder, Al-mubarac. 'It has recently been reported that the Colorado Muslim Society has offered to provide burial services for Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the individuals who perpetrated the grave and destructive bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon. This report is absolutely untrue. The individual who has reportedly made this offer does not speak on behalf of the Colorado Muslim Society,' the statement says. It continues, 'The Colorado Muslim Society strongly condemns all acts of violence and grieves with all of America after the attacks in Boston. The conduct of Tamerlan Tsarnaev is abhorrent and contrary to every principle and belief that underlies the purpose of the Colorado Muslim Society.' The Colorado Muslim Society's general counsel Qusair Mohamedbhai told The Denver Post 'we would never, ever do something like that \u2014 offer to bury someone who has committed an extreme act of violence against this country.' Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Montgomery Village, Maryland, has . been unable to bury his nephew in Massachusetts because of protests. The funeral director who currently has the . body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in his possession has made a plea to the State Department to . help him settle what will happen with the remains. The city of Cambridge, where the . suspected bombers lived prior to the attack, refused to bury the body. Mr . Stefan, whose business in Worcester, Massachusetts has been picketed by . protesters, said that everyone deserves a dignified burial. Decision time: Peter Stefan told a news conference on Monday that a decision had to be reached after the city of Cambridge refused to bury the body of suspected bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev there . The impasse over 26-year-old Tsarnaev's body came as a local man started a fundraising campaign to have the alleged terrorist's body returned to his family in Russia. William Breault, from Worcester, has kick-started the campaign with $500 to send the body back to Tsarnaev's parents. Mr Stefan said on Monday that he understood the reluctance to deal with the remains following the atrocious attacks last month. However he told NBC: 'Everyone wants him sent back to Russia. I'm gonna get on the phone with the necessary people and say, ''We need help with this.''' The funeral director added: 'It also makes us look bad. In this country, we bury people. We don't leave them hanging around.' Mr Stefan said that he believed that alleged terrorist's family want his body returned to Russia. Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva has repeatedly claimed that her son's were framed for the Boston bombing. A State Department spokesman said that Tsarnaev's family should contact the Russian Consulate for help while Massachusetts Governor Patrick Deval called the burial a 'family issue'. Family: Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni arrived at Mr Stefan's funeral home on Sunday where Tsarnaev awaits burial rites . Determined: Funeral director Peter Stefan accepted the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, to give him a 'dignified burial' Cambridge city manager Robert Healy said on Sunday that Tsarnaev's body was not welcomed in one of its cemeteries. 'I . have determined that it is not in the best interest of peace within the . city to execute a cemetery deed for a plot within the Cambridge . Cemetery for the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev,' Healey said. Tsarnaev's uncle  Ruslan Tsarni visited the funeral home over the weekend to claim his nephew's body. Tsarni chose to step in, he said, . because 'no one wants to associate their names with such evil events' and because religion and tradition call for his nephew to be buried. Every cemetery in Massachusetts has turned down the body of Tsarnaev but Mr Stefan remains insistent that this death be handled like any other. He has also reached out unsuccessfully to cemeteries in New Jersey and Connecticut. Some protesters outside the funeral home believe the bombing suspect should be buried at sea, similar to what was done with the body of Osama bin Laden. Other protestors simply did not want Tsarnaev's remains in their town, like retired firefighter Ronald Wahlers. 'It\u2019s going to give this neighborhood a bad name,' Wahlers, who has lived in Worcester for a year and a half, told the Boston Globe. 'This guy doesn\u2019t belong here.' Watching: Police remained at funeral parlors where the body of Tsarnaev was taken and where protestors followed . Fiona Gilley, left, and her sister Nairi Melkonian, both of Worcester, Mass., hold signs urging compassion while they stand on the other side of the street from protestors on Sunday . Tsarnaev, 26, died from \u2018gunshot . wounds of torso and extremities\u2019 and blunt trauma to his head and torso. The certificate lists the time of his death as 1.35am on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing. Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the U.S. ten years ago. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing. Tsarnaev's family was making arrangements Friday for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured the day after his brother's death. Body: Tsarvaev's body is now at Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, waiting to be buried . The body was released by the state medical examiner on Thursday. It initially was taken to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters, before being taken to Mr Stefan's funeral parlor, which is familiar with Muslim services. Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth. Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to national TV. Authorities plan to look at security procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said. Governor Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event. As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities have been searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found . hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston . suburb, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of . helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his . dormitory room before the FBI searched it. The . April 15 bombing, which used pressure cookers packed with explosives, . nails, ball bearings and metal shards, killed three people and injured . more than 260 others near the marathon's finish line. Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated . The brothers decided to carry out the attack before Independence Day when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said. The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained on Friday. The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings. The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated on Thursday and came one day after the Obama administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa. Tazhayakov's lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy .",

    "input": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Even the most banal question is met with an amusing and thought-provoking response from Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie, the two quipsters behind \"Flight of the Conchords.\" Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie are a struggling musical duo in \"Flight of the Conchords.\" \"What's your favorite color?\" went an innocuous query. \"Transparent,\" replied  Clement. \"Umm ... bluish-red,\" said McKenzie. Wait, isn't that ... purple? No matter. Absurd comedy comes as easily to the duo as useless advice flows from Murray, their always-dressed-in-brown band manager (played by Rhys Darby) on their hit HBO program. Five minutes in an elevator, a hallway, or an interview room with Clement and McKenzie, and a scene worthy of inclusion on the show effortlessly unfolds.  Watch the group talk about the price of fame \u00bb . Of course the native New Zealanders possess more smarts than their on-screen personas, two scrappy, clueless musicians trying -- and failing miserably -- to break into the music business in New York City. But the resemblance is as clear as the giant, idolizing blue eyes of their lone fan, Mel (Kristen Schaal). \"Most of the stories are based on things that happened to us,\" says McKenzie. \"We take one element, and then we kind of exaggerate it or twist it.\" Consider the series' second episode of the new season (which started earlier this month), where Bret and Jemaine squabbled over Bret's \"extravagant\" purchase of a new coffee mug (it cost $2.79). Could a similar scenario have played out when the pair lived together as university students in their homeland more than 10 years ago? \"We were very poor,\" recalls Clement. \"Sometimes in our flat we would have so little money that we were trying to think of schemes, like how can we make some money today so that we can have some dinner.\" With the economy taking a turn for the worst in recent months, \"Flight of the Conchords\" now seems more relevant. \"We basically never set out to have the show be a credit crunch show,\" says co-executive producer and co-creator James Bobin. \"But it seems the world has caught up with us.\" And CNN caught up with Clement and McKenzie (Bobin, too) to talk about writing silly songs, the sweet tooth of success and to find out why Aussies -- such as CNN's interviewer -- are always in the cross hairs. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: The show is a big hit around the world. Do you consider yourselves worthy cultural ambassadors for New Zealand? Jemaine Clement: I think in some ways our characters are typical of New Zealanders. New Zealand has a reputation as being one of the most boring peoples of the world. You don't know of that? CNN: I wouldn't agree with that. Bret McKenzie: Friendly. I think they're famous for being friendly. Clement: Well, I've heard boring. CNN: As an Australian, I would like to know why you make fun of Australians so much. McKenzie: Because we find them funny. Clement: We've toured in Australia and ... it always struck me when we went out to lunch with people how many times we would be made fun of because of our accents. So we stored up all that resentment and we waited years ... McKenzie: And unleashed it. Clement: We're giving it back to the Australians who made fun of us. CNN: James, what is it like to work with these two? James Bobin: It's a pleasure, obviously. We've been friends for years now. ... The show's incredibly hard work because obviously we do music and comedy at the same time and that's quite a challenge. But they're both very hardworking so it makes it easy. CNN: What's it like on set? I imagine when the cameras start rolling that a lot of what happens is improvised. Bobin: To a certain degree, yeah. We have a script that we like ... so we obviously try to nail that first. And from that position we just play with it a little bit and see where we go. Especially with Rhys, because Rhys is such a brilliant improviser and these guys and Rhys do so well together in those scenes in the band meetings. Often they go way off script. Clement: Yeah, we try and write the script with parts that we know we can improvise off. So we leave some things open-ended. McKenzie: It's between 17 and 18 percent improvised. Clement: But this interview is a hundred percent. CNN: A lot of the musical numbers from the first season you had in stock before you even made the TV show ... Clement: The songs in the second season are not worse than the songs in the first season. CNN: That wasn't going to be my question! How challenging was it to come up with a whole new set of songs? Clement: Well, I think that was the fun part of the show because playing music is fun. Bobin: Also, we had some stories in mind so this time round we could write songs to fit with the stories -- which was kind of nice because last year it was a bit harder to squeeze the songs into a storyline. It just made for very strange situations. Clement: Yeah, and having the songs in the beginning sometimes leads to boring storylines because all the songs are about girls. So when we have a whole lot of storylines about girls our episodes have to be about girls. So we could go off that a bit this time. CNN: How confident are you both in your abilities as musicians? McKenzie: 24 to 27 percent. Clement: I'm 24. He's 27. McKenzie: Combined we're mediocre. CNN: How are you enjoying the fame that's come from the success? McKenzie: Oh it's lovely. You get free desserts. CNN: Just free desserts? McKenzie: Free drinks. Sometimes some free shoes. Clement: Sometimes people invade your privacy. McKenzie: Strangers talk to you. Clement: But balanced against the free desserts, it evens out. CNN: Have you encountered any Mel-like fans? McKenzie: A lot of fans like to come up and say they're the real Mel. Or \"you've actually got two fans.\" CNN: Did you know someone who was like Murray? Is he based on a friend or a stereotype? Clement: In some ways, our real manager in New Zealand. McKenzie: She's very maternal. I think Murray's quite a maternal figure. Clement: She gives us lists that are overly detailed. And when we were going to a new country she'd be very worried for our safety. Not that long ago Tenacious D [Jack Black's band] came to New Zealand and we were asked to open for them, and she didn't know who they were, even though they're the biggest musical comedy act ever. And that carries through to Murray. CNN: How surprised were you by the success of the show? McKenzie: I'm surprised by the diversity of the fans. Like there are people who are our age, which makes sense, and then there are people in their 70s who love the show. And then there are children who love the show. There's a scene in the show where I watch television in a box. I get a box sent over from New Zealand. And my friend's son, he watches TV sitting in a box. And he's 9. It's great. HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.",

    "input": "By . Victoria Woollaston . Following reports that billions of bee colonies across the world are facing extinction, a team of designers have decided to take matters into their own hands. The Open Source Beehives project has been set up so beekeepers - both amateur and professional - can print and assemble smart hives that monitor and track the health of bee colonies globally. The hives are sold either on their own, or with a sensory kit that sends data to an open platform called Smartcitizen. This data is then analysed by experts in a bid to find a solution to the decreasing bee populations. The Open Source Beehive project has been set up so beekeepers - both amateur and professional - can print and assemble smart beehives that monitor and track the health of colonies. The design of the open-source hive, pictured, is based on the traditional design of the Warre Hive . A team of Australian scientists plan to mount tiny sensors to 5,000 honey bees and monitor where they fly. The plan will be the first of its kind to track bees as they move in real-time. The sensors use radio frequency identification chips and would record when the bee passes a certain point. This data would then be sent back to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to be analysed. This sensory kit was developed by Fab Lab . Barcelona and is an open source platform, including hardware, a website and an app. The designs of the open-source hives are based on the traditional look of the Warre Hive, or People\u2019s Hive. It is built by adding hives boxes to the bottom of the structure - rather than the top - to encourage bees to build down. This is how they typically create their hives in the wild. The parts of the open-source hives are printed on a 3D printer and are shipped in flatpack boxes before being assembled.

The parts of the open-source hives are printed on a 3D printer and are shipped in flatpack boxes before being assembled . All the sections then slot together, removing the need for potentially harmful screws and glue. The designs for the hives, called the Colorado Top Bar and the Barcelona Warre, are also downloadable and available from the project\u2019s Indiegogo campaign. This means anyone with their own 3D printer can produce their own range of hives at home. \u2018These hives aim to prioritise bee colony health, make beekeeping more accessible and will ultimately allow you to log and study the health of your colony,\u2019 said the designers. The hives are sold either on their own, or with a sensory kit, pictured, that sends data to an open platform called Smartcitizen.

The data sent to the Smartcitizen platform, plus the geolocation tags, are used to compare and analyse the hives to help prevent decreasing bee populations. Stock image of honeybees pictured . \u2018Your contribution will help us develop sensors to enhance our hives, connecting them to the Internet to log data about what is causing the bees to disappear around the world. \u2018This data can be used to study colony health, build hard evidence against the causes of the problem and generate policy change and informed solutions moving forward.\u2019 The sensors that collect data can also be used to send warnings to a smartphone in the event of an emergency, or if something goes wrong. For $100 (\u00a360), Indiegogo investors receive a Mini-Hive kit sold with a miniature laser-cut beehive and the download kit. The download kit on its own costs $15 (\u00a39). The full-sized hives cost $300 (\u00a3180) without sensors, or $600 (\u00a3361) with the full Smartcitizen pack. All packs are due to shipped this month.",

    "input": "Chicago (CNN) -- More than three years after actress and singer Jennifer Hudson's mother, brother and nephew were killed, jury selection began Monday in the murder trial of the man charged in their deaths. William Balfour, the estranged husband of Hudson's sister Julia, is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother and brother inside their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found three days later inside an abandoned vehicle. Balfour, who was also Julian's stepfather, has also been charged with one count of home invasion. About 150 people are candidates to be among the 12 jurors or six alternates in the case. The process of whittling down this pool began Monday morning in a Chicago courtroom, and by mid-afternoon, nine jurors had been selected while several others had been excused for hardship reasons. Judge Charles Burns has said he hopes to have the jury finalized by Wednesday. Then there will be a break, with the opening statements in the case set for April 23. The judge has told the would-be jurors that he expects the trial to last three to four weeks. Balfour was detained for questioning the day after the victims were found at the Chicago home. Authorities at the time said that they were holding Balfour for an unspecified parole violation, but he ended up being indicted for murder two months later. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyer has said in court there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings. Prosecutors have portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered three people in rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend. The deaths took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on \"American Idol,\" won an Oscar for her role in the movie \"Dreamgirls.\" In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother, Darnell Donerson. \"My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,\" she said. Hudson, who is on the witness list, is expected to attend the upcoming trial. Her career has continued to blossom and remain varied since her relatives' deaths. Her recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight, being cast to play Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie in an upcoming movie, releasing a new album and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the most recent Grammy awards in February. CNN's Ted Rowlands in Chicago and Alan Duke in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",

Jack Vale, 41, uprooted his wife, and their five children, from their home Hungtington Beach, California, in order to move them to Las Vegas, after the now-infamous prankster's celebrity status in their local area left him unable to film his normal hidden-camera comedy series without being spotted. 'We knew we had to go somewhere because we were being recognized,' the YouTube star told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Too famous? Jack Vale, 41, revealed to Daily Mail Online that he and his family were forced to think about moving after he began being recognized in his local area .

And in addition to keeping his YouTube content fresh and interesting, Jack admits his family's move to Sin City was also motivated by another factor: his new HLN reality series Jack Vale: Offline. The show documents the family's move from California to Nevada, and follows the Vale clan as they set out to unleash their finest pranks and practical jokes on the people of Las Vegas. 'It's been so exciting to be in a new place, with so many more people there to interact with and work with,' Jack said.

Not only is the weekend lie in the stuff of your weekday dreams, but sleep, along with food, water and oxygen, is essential for human survival. And the amount of shut eye a person gets each night, provides a vital indicator of their overall health. But it seems some of us aren't getting enough time between the sheets. A new study, by experts at the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) in the US, has recommended children aged four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously advised. Scroll down for video . A new study by experts at the National Sleep Foundation in the US has recommended how much sleep a person needs at each stage in life, ranging from 14 to 17 hours as a newborn to seven to eight hours as an older adult, aged over 65, pictured . Past studies have found a lack of sleep can increase a person's risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, shortening life expectancy. In order to determine exactly how much sleep a person needs at each stage of their life, a team of 18 specialists from sleep, anatomy and physiology, as well as paediatrics, neurology, gerontology and gynaecology\u00a0convened to form an expert panel.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Mitt Romney hates apologies. That's why he leaped to the conclusion that, in the wake of the killing of Libya Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other State Department employees, the Obama administration had issued an apology for America's actions. \"It's a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values,\" Romney declared. \"It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.\" What Romney called a disgraceful response by the Obama administration to the Libyan killings was in fact a statement issued before the killings by America's Cairo Embassy condemning an anti-Islam film that portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a child molester. The title of Romney's 2010 campaign autobiography, \"No Apology: The Case for American Greatness,\" makes it clear that his hatred of apologies runs deep. Unfortunately, such hatred ignores history. What Romney, who after disparaging 47% of Americans for being dependents has insisted there was nothing wrong in what he said, fails to understand is that presidential apologies are nothing new. What's more is that they apologize without drawing critical backlash from their fellow conservatives. Bill Clinton's 1998 apology for the failure of America and the international community to respond quickly to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda may be the most memorable public apology by any contemporary president. But two of the most conservative Republicans in recent history, it is worth pointing out, have issued telling public apologies of their own. The most moving of these conservative apologies was the one that Ronald Reagan made in 1988 on signing the legislation that provided $1.25 billion in reparations, along with a formal apology from the government, for the forcible relocation of 120,000 West Coast Japanese-Americans after the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In signing the bill, Reagan, who as an actor was living in California at the time of the relocation, made clear that the money offered to the victimized families was less important than the public apology. \"No payment can make up for those lost years,\" Reagan said. \"So what is important in this bill has less to do with property than with honor, for here, we admit a wrong.\" Today those words have taken on enduring form. In Washington they are engraved on the National Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II, which is within blocks of the Capitol. In addition to Reagan's words, the memorial features a towering sculpture of two bronze cranes, each with one wing pointing to the sky and the other pinned down by barbed wire. Two decades later, George W. Bush, the Republican closest in ideology to Ronald Reagan, made a similar statement of regret. In a 2008 video conference with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of Iraq, Bush apologized for the actions of an American sniper in Iraq who used a Quran for target practice. \"He apologized for that in the sense that he said that we take it very seriously,\" White House press secretary Dana Perino told reporters after the video conference. \"We wanted them to know that the president knew that this was wrong.\" The impacts that Reagan, Clinton and Bush hoped their individual apologies would have turned out to be as different as their politics. That is to be expected. For their apologies were never just based on calculation. At their core was the shared belief that a presidential apology is not a sign of weakness so much as a chance for a new beginning, a way to shed the indefensible and start fresh. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- HBO's deadly \"Game of Thrones\" returned Sunday night with one ominous rallying cry -- \"All men must die\" -- and few disappointments. Now that it's in its fourth season, the fantasy series could be excused if it started to show wear and tear. After all, we've seen programs with simpler plots and fewer cast members lose their edge in less time. But Sunday's premiere, \"Two Swords,\" proved that creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are just getting started. (In fact, the only real letdown for fans didn't have anything to do with \"GoT\" at all, but HBO's mobile platform HBO Go, which crashed due to an overwhelming demand for Sunday's premiere.) HBO Go crashes under heavy 'Game of Thrones' demand . Adapted from George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" book series, \"Game of Thrones\" is at its heart a bloody race for power between competitive houses in Westeros. After the third season left avid watchers in a state of shock thanks to a gruesome wedding ceremony, they returned on Sunday to find the \"Game's\" major players repositioning themselves on the board. With the famous Stark Valyrian steel sword split in two by Hand of the King Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance), viewers were made keenly aware of the fissures that abound throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) is building an army while trying to keep a handle on her still-growing dragons, and Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) has begun to cross out names on her list of vengeance. In the North, the Free Folk -- or the Wildlings as they're called -- have their eyes trained on breaching the Wall where the men of the Night's Watch, including a Jon Snow (Kit Harington) ready to pay for his broken vows, stand guard. And in King's Landing, where the precious Iron Throne sits, the ruthless and rich Lannisters are not as secure as they'd like to believe. With a grand wedding approaching for the young King Joffrey, there are visitors from Dorne afoot -- and they, too, like to pay their debts. \"Right off the bat, season four sends the viewer a signal: Forget the Westeros you knew,\" warns the A.V. Club's Erik Adams, who gave the episode a B+ grade. \"Forget where on the board you've mentally placed any of 'Game Of Thrones'' chess pieces. It's not a reboot, but 'Two Swords' is a starting place that feels distinct.\" While \"fortunes have risen and fallen while we were away, and the awful power of King Joffrey seeps deeply into the Seven Kingdoms,\" the episode \"stealthily belongs to the Starks -- who are down, but not out. That's an enticingly rich way to begin a season.\" Time magazine's Eric Dodds agrees that while \"the Lannisters appear strong and unchallenged with the Starks out of the picture and Jaime returned home only slightly worse for wear, the cracks are readily apparent. ... By all accounts, the season-opener was setting the table for what promises to be a season filled with violence and intrigue. For now, the fear is only creeping in along the edges. Once it arrives in full, that's when the real fun is likely to begin.\" It's true that not much happened in the way of action -- by \"GoT\" standards, anyway -- but it was rich in character development, says The Daily Beast's Andrew Romano. \"(A)nd character, ultimately, is what 'Game of Thrones' does best,\" he observes. \"Some viewers might even complain that there wasn't enough sex or swashbuckling in 'Two Swords' -- that the episode was 'slow.' But it is in these slow moments -- the moments between each big plot twist, when showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff decelerate the narrative to linger over the nuances of character -- that 'Game of Thrones' truly distinguishes itself from other epic television series.\" Even better, The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman says that the next two episodes should be just as good. \"The consistent excellence in 'Game of Thrones' is truly something to behold,\" Goodman says in a review. \"Even in three episodes, viewers will sense things tightening up -- that winter and war are coming and they are coming on full-stop. If there's anything to complain about with 'Game of Thrones' it's the 10-episode seasons, which cry out for 13 episodes given the immense world that 'Thrones' inhabits.\"",
    "output": "\"Game of Thrones\" began its fourth season on Sunday .\nCritics say it upheld the show's reputation as one of the best programs on TV .\nWhile it wasn't as action-packed, it did explore character development .\nThe subsequent two episodes are expected to be just as good ."

    "input": "Atlanta (CNN) -- The last time I talked to Anthony Shadid, I made him promise not to become another headline. He didn't keep his promise. I learned through a headline -- along with the rest of the world -- of his death in Syria, apparently of an asthma attack. Don't become a headline. It seems trite now. It was meant as a light exchange with him, after he and three other New York Times journalists were released from captivity in Libya. I had just watched him and the others in a CNN interview on AC360 with Anderson Cooper, detailing their harrowing captivity at the hands of Moammar Gadhafi's forces. And, at the time, it seemed like a good thing to say. New York Times reporter dies in Syria . I never believed it would be one of the last conversations I would have with Anthony, who early in my career had been my mentor and my editor and later my colleague and, I like to think, my friend. I am struggling with the news of his death and with the knowledge that I will never get to have another conversation. The news stories about his death spell out the extraordinary career that took him from California to New York, from Cairo to Baghdad, from Tripoli to Beirut. They tell how he worked for the Associated Press, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post and, finally, The New York Times. They tell of the two Pulitzer Prizes he won in 2004 and 2010 for his reporting from Iraq. They even detail his willingness to stand up to an editor to fight for his story. As a journalist, I know that stories are not supposed to be personal. They are supposed to be about the facts. But the fact is the death of Anthony Shadid is personal. The first time I met him was in the Associated Press newsroom in Los Angeles. I already knew him by name, from his byline. He had just moved from Cairo, Egypt, and was to be my news editor. That day, over a cup of coffee, he asked me about stories and subject matter that I found fascinating. He asked what I wanted out of my career, where I wanted to go with it. Neither of us had any idea at the time where our paths would lead, or that we would find ourselves years later standing together at a party in Baghdad talking about career paths. That day, in Los Angeles, it was a conversation about how to tell better stories. I wanted to be better, and he promised to help me. Anthony told me about the stories he loved writing, reading and editing. They were stories about people and their conditions. And the best stories, he told me, were full of color and context. Those stories, he said, make a difference. When I asked him for an example, something I could read to better understand, he gave me a list of journalists whose work I should follow. What I remember most: His name was not on the list. During his tenure in Los Angeles, he kept his word and worked with me. Once, after a harried editing session, I asked him if he missed being a reporter. \"Every day,\" he said. In May 2000, the news that Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork and AP cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora were killed in an ambush in Sierra Leone sent shock waves through the industry. Anthony knew Kurt and Miguel. He was angry, upset they had put themselves in harm's way. At least that's how I remember his reaction, and I remember being confused by it. Wasn't that their job? Wasn't that sometimes part of the risk? Today, I understand his reaction. It was the same one I had when I found out that he had he died. When Anthony took a reporting job at The Boston Globe, he called to tell me of the pending announcement that he was leaving the Associated Press. I asked why he wanted to leave, though I already knew: Anthony was a reporter, a storyteller. He made his first headline in 2002, when he was shot in the back of the shoulder while leaving Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah. When the news broke, my colleagues tracked down a phone number for him in a hospital in the region. I was surprised that he answered the phone himself. He was in good spirits, and he laughed over the fact that so many people had managed to track him down half way around the world. \"Does everybody know where I am?\" he said. The answer: Dude, you're the headline. During that conversation, I reminded him of our discussion two years earlier about Kurt and Miguel. You remember that? he said, sounding surprised. Over the years, Anthony and I managed to stay in touch sporadically through e-mails. Like many people, I followed his reports from Iraq during the early days of the war. It was his stories about the Iraqi people that gave me the truest sense of what life was like for the millions caught up in the war. When I got the opportunity to go to Baghdad in 2008 to cover what would become the beginning of the end of U.S. involvement in Iraq, I sent Anthony an e-mail to let him know. He wrote back, warning me to be careful and not to take too many risks. He also told me to tell great stories. When I got off the plane at Baghdad International Airport, among the items I carried with me was Anthony's book \"Night Draws Near: Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War.\" Not long ago, unpacking boxes after moving to Atlanta to take a job with CNN, I stumbled onto a picture of Anthony. It was taken in December 2009 at a Christmas party in Baghdad that the Reuters news agency hosted. He was smiling, with his arm around his pregnant wife. She had made the trip with him from their new home in Lebanon. He was beaming as he introduced her, clearly enjoying this new chapter in his life. When it was revealed that the baby was due shortly before Iraq was to hold its elections for Parliament and prime minister, a story the world was following, I asked Anthony what he was going to do if the delivery was late. Overheard on CNN.com: Readers weigh in on Shadid . His wife, journalist Nada Bakri, answered for him: The baby will be on time. We spent hours that night catching up, recalling assignments, colleagues and developments in our lives. And we laughed. I found out later that the Anthony's wife gave birth to a son, Malik, about the same time as Anthony was making headlines again -- this time for winning his second Pulitzer Prize for international reporting. I last saw Anthony in Baghdad in 2010 at my goodbye party. I was wrapping up a 17-month assignment. It was a bittersweet moment. He asked me what was next. I told him I didn't know. Anthony gave me a throaty laugh, hugged me and said, \"Write well.\" As the word spreads about his death, there will be many whose lives he influenced and, in some cases, forever changed, that will step forward. I am just one.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Friday night provided Congress with a new batch of Operation Fast and Furious documents from early 2011. They show a top Justice Department official and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives acting director suggested illegally purchased weapons be allowed to cross into Mexico where Mexican officials would be waiting to arrest, prosecute and convict the gun traffickers. Justice also sent a letter to Capitol Hill leaders providing details of a series of reforms made by the Justice Department and ATF to ensure there is no repeat of the controversial operation which allowed hundreds of illegal weapons to be sold in the United States and trafficked into Mexico. The intent of the operation was to monitor the flow of the weapons to their ultimate destination. The ATF plan was to track the weapons to Mexican drug cartels. However, hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for. The Justice documents include an e-mail from a U.S. official in the Mexican Embassy which shows that in a meeting in early 2011 U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer suggested the illegal weapons could be intercepted if the two nations worked together. Then acting ATF chief Ken Melson made similar suggestions. Breuer \"suggested allowing straw purchasers cross into Mexico so (Mexican federal police) can arrest and (the Mexican attorney general's office] can prosecute and convict.\" The e-mail author, a Justice official stationed at the embassy, said he thought that was risky because Mexico might not seize the weapons and a crime could be committed. The Justice officials were in Mexico City to coordinate with that nation's authorities after the death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry near the Mexican border. Two illegally purchased weapons which were lost in Mexico were discovered at the crime scene where Terry was slain. The controversy is the subject of a hearing set for next Thursday. Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to testify before the House Investigations Committee chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California). Holder is likely to stress the changes and reforms that have been made since the flawed operation occurred. In the letter to key congressional leaders Friday, the Justice Department said ATF policy now says it may be necessary to interdict illegal weapons early to ensure the safety of the public. The Justice Department also revealed that undercover operations have to be reviewed by an internal committee if they involve \"sensitive circumstances.\" The letter to Congress also says ATF agents are undergoing special training \"based on the lessons\" of Fast and Furious.",

Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced an official memorial for the Australian victims of MH17 . Nearly 300 people, including 37 Australian citizens and permanent residents, died when a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine two weeks ago. The service was being held in Melbourne because 16 of the victims came from Victoria, Mr Abbott said. On the day of the service, flags on all Australian government buildings, here and overseas, will be flown at half-mast. Arrangements have been made for an outside broadcast in anticipation of large crowds. Among the large Victorian death toll was Shaliza Dewal, 45, and her Dutch husband Hans Van Den Hende. The Malaysian-Dutch couple were travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with their three children, Piers, 15, Marnix, 12, and daughter Margaux, 8 but never made it home.

Australian and Dutch police investigators were forced to abandon the search for remains again on Wednesday because of fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist fighters. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said claims investigators are being deterred from the MH17 crash site by land mines are 'utterly despicable'. Ms Bishop said she is aware of reports that Ukrainian rebels have been laying land mines on roads through to the crash site of the downed flight in eastern Ukraine.

'It's heartbreaking, it's so distressing. 'We have the team in place, we have the experts ready to work, and we can't get to the site.'

Cunningham is the successor to Nathan Brown, who stepped down following his club's 14-6 Grand Final triumph over Wigan last weekend. The former St George and Huddersfield boss was released 12 months early from his three-year contract in order to take his young family back to Australia. Keiron Cunningham has been named St Helens' head coach after working as their assistant head coach . Nathan Brown (left) holds the Super League trophy with Paul Wellens after victory against Wigan Warriors . Cunningham was an assistant to Brown for the previous two seasons. Chairman Eamonn McManus told the club's official website saintsrlfc.com: 'Keiron is ready for this professionally and totally committed to the task ahead of him. 'He has been heavily involved in the success of this season and is ideally placed to carry it on for years to come.' Cunningham has signed a two-year contract and will be assisted by former New Zealand Test centre Jamahl Lolesi, who worked alongside him after following Brown from Huddersfield two years ago. The 37-year-old former Great Britain hooker is immortalised in bronze outside Langtree Park, where he was unveiled on Monday as Saints' first British coach for 14 years. Cunningham will also be the first man to coach his home-town club since Alex Murphy held the reins from 1985-90. St Helens players celebrate their Super League Grand Final win against Wigan at Old Trafford . McManus added: 'Keiron is highly respected by the players. 'Not only does he understand our culture, he has been instrumental in its development since the inception of Super League. 'Everyone at the club is totally behind his appointment and enthused by it.' The appointment is sure to go down well with supporters, who in 2010 overwhelmingly selected him from a list of all-time greats to be the subject of a bronze, life-size statue, which was erected in the town centre and moved to Langtree Park when St Helens moved into their new stadium three years ago. Cunningham, who turns 38 next week, made 419 appearances for his home-town club from 1993 to 2010. Cunningham, pictured in action for St Helens, made 419 appearances for the club over 17 years . McManus said: 'His appointment will result in both continuity and stability within the club. We have a strong, young and exciting playing squad and we are well placed to compete at the highest level for many years ahead. 'CEO Mike Rush, Keiron and myself have worked together at the club in one form or another for 14 years. We understand the town and the club and their highest expectations. We will together continue to do our very best to meet them.' Cunningham is the club's second British head coach in the history of Super League. Ellery Hanley held the post from 1998 to 2000 in between spells by Australians Shaun McRae, Ian Millward, Daniel Anderson, Mick Potter and Royce Simmons. The appointment leaves just two overseas coaches in charge of the 12 Super League clubs - Warrington's former England boss Tony Smith, who has British citizenship, and Wakefield's James Webster, who at 35 in the youngest head coach in the top flight.",

Aimee West was 3,500 miles away in Afghanistan when she learned that the fusilier had been hacked him to death in front of horrified onlookers near Woolwich Barracks in south-east London on May 22 last year. His killers Michael Adebolajo received a whole-life term, while Michael Adebowale, was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years. Scroll down for video . Aimee West pictured with her fiance Lee Rigby before his death. She says that she has a daily battle to block thoughts about the two Islamic extremists who murdered him . Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales and became engaged in 2013 . A Parliamentary report is expected to say that some of the online behaviour by Adebolajo before Fusilier Rigby's death could have pointed to his intentions. Now in a interview with the Telegraph, Miss West, 24, says she doesn't think about the killers as she refuses to let them ruin her memories of her fiance. She told the newspaper: 'I had a lot of therapy after this happened and the one thing that stuck with me was that if I think about them, if I have any emotion towards them - they've won. 'They haven't just killed Lee, they've killed me as well. And I refuse to let them do that. 'It's as if I'm standing on the outside looking in, like everybody else. I've mentally detached myself to be able to cope.' Miss West began a relationship with Mr Rigby in 2012 when they met at an Army Cadets training event in Wales. Miss West, left, has now said she refuses to think about the killers of her fiance, Lee, right . The 25-year-old father-of-one was then estranged from his wife Rebecca, who he had his son Jack with, and was getting a divorce. The following year, before the military police woman flew away for a tour of Afghanistan, he proposed and she accepted. Following Mr Rigby's death, Miss West says she has now quit the Army and has gone back to university, where she is studying to be a lawyer. She also set up the Lee Rigby Fund as part of the Soldiers' Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale who were both convicted of murdering Lee Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks last year . British-born Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car as he was walking towards the barracks wearing a Help for Heroes hoodie, before hacking him to death. They both claimed that they were \u2018soldiers of Allah\u2019 and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing, which they called an 'act of war'. Mayhem broke out at the Old Bailey earlier this year as the remorseless killers disrupted proceedings when they were accused of a 'betrayal' of Islam. As he was about to be jailed for life without parole Adebolajo shouted Allahu Akbhar, and Adebowale called out \u2018that's a lie\u2019 and \u2018it's not a betrayal of Islam\u2019 as the judge told them they had been radicalised. Last week it was revealed that internet service providers did not raise the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in the six months before his death. The companies - who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services - failed to inform authorities about material posted by Michael Adebolajo before the attack he carried out with Michael Adebowale. Floral tributes were left at the scene near Woolwich Barracks where Fusilier Rigby was targeted as he walked along the street wearing a Help for Heroes hoodie . It meant MI5 missed internet messages that could have alerted them to the threat posed by the murderers. A long-awaited report by Parliament\u2019s intelligence watchdog is expected to say Adebolajo was posting extremist material on social media sites in the months leading up to the attack. The messages would have been sufficiently serious to justify the security services \u2013 who had had Adebolajo on their radar for eight years \u2013 putting him under more detailed surveillance. But officers found out about them only after the sickening murder of the 25-year-old soldier outside Woolwich Barracks in May last year.

But now online abuse and identify theft have become so common that social media users are being sold specialist insurance to help protect their reputation in case of an attack. Hacking of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media accounts - where another user logs in and posts derogatory or offensive messages - can cause huge damage to an individual or business\u2019s image. Protection: Hacking of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media accounts can cause huge damage to an individual or business's image . A UK-based information privacy company has launched the country\u2019s first social media insurance to specifically protect against reputational damage, account jacking and ID theft. Justin Basini, CEO of the company providing the service, ALLOW, said that insurance \u2018perhaps wouldn\u2019t have been needed a few years ago.\u2019 He added: \u2018That\u2019s all changed now. Every internet user faces a certain level of risk that one day a digital criminal will target them or that they will suffer damage to their reputation.\u2019 The cover - at a cost of \u00a33.99 a month - will pay for legal advice and support if someone suffers an online attack and seeks some form of redress. It includes the cost of disabling accounts, suppressing offensive material and stopping any legal action triggered by hacking, for example if a hacker posts illegal material under a victim\u2019s name. Mother-of-one Nicola Brookes was hounded for nine months by anonymous bullies who set up a Facebook profile in her name and set explicit messages to children, after she wrote an innocent message of support for an X Factor contestant online. Social networks: Online abuse and identify theft are so common that social media users are being sold specialist insurance to help protect their reputation .

Miss Brookes, 45, won a landmark legal case to compel Facebook to release the bullies\u2019 details in June and hopes to bring private prosecutions against them. Her legal action would have cost her \u00a35,000 but her solicitors Bains Cohen agreed to represent her for free because of her horrific ordeal. As the number of similar cases rises and the likelihood of solicitors taking on more work pro bono diminishes, more people may be tempted to pay for insurance. Ian Giles, a marketing consultant from Surrey, has signed up to the insurance. He runs his business under his name and is concerned that it could be ruined if his social media accounts were hacked. \u2018My name is my brand,\u2019 he said. \u2018If someone were to impersonate me online then it would cause damage to my business.

The Gunners secured their passage into the Champions League group stages with a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund - but their glee was tempered by injuries to captain Mikel Arteta (calf) and Yaya Sanogo (hamstring). 'The injury situation is a problem because we have many games,' said Wenger. Mikel Arteta injured his calf muscle during the second half of Arsenal's win over Borussia Dortmund . Arteta immediately signalled to the bench to confirm he was injured and would need to be taken off . Arteta looks in pain as he hobbles after picking up a calf injury . Arteta and Sanogo will be assessed at the club's London Colney HQ on Thursday to establish the prognosis. But the Spaniard's loss will spark a change in transfer strategy from the Gunners when the January window re-opens. Jack Wilshere's ankle injury had already forced Wenger into rethinking his transfer plans. Yaya Sanogo scored Arsenal's first goal against Borussia Dortmund at the Emirates on Wednesday night . Sanogo (second right) also had to come off injured himself, later in the game . The Arsenal manager is still prioritising the capture of at least two central defenders; a position the Gunners have been dreadfully short this season. But, even prior to Wednesday night, Wenger is also now looking to sign a central midfielder to replace Wilshere - who could be out for four months if he needs surgery on his injured left ankle. Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender remains Wenger's dream signing, but Sportsmail understands they are also showing an interest in Sevilla's Grzegorz Krychowiak, who could be cheaper option. Their defensive targets include Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Ipswich left-back Tyrone Mings. But Arteta's injury will only heighten Wenger's desire to sign a new central midfielder when the window re-opens. Sanogo celebrates scoring his first goal for Arsenal - before picking up a hamstring injury . Arsenal expect to discover whether or not Wilshere will require surgery when he sees a specialist.

Danny Welbeck (knee), Mesut Ozil (knee), Wojciech Szczesny (hip), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle), Theo Walcott (groin) and David Ospina (thigh) all missed the clash through injury. Despite the setbacks, Arsenal produced a fine 2-0 win against Dortmund to confirm their place in the last 16 of the Champions League. On his side's 15th consecutive qualification for the Champions League knockout stages, Wenger added: 'When you work at the football club we realise it's not easy to have that continuity and consistency and I'm very proud of that. 'The club deserves a lot of credit for that. But it's not enough, we want more than that. 'The focus to defend well together. We had a similar game to Saturday (a 2-1 defeat to Manchester United) but we focused really well. It was a committed game, and maybe defensively we were better tonight. 'We have done our job.

    "input": "Cheered: Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski with Prime Minster David Cameron . A divorced Tory MP and Cabinet aide was cheered and clapped by his local party after telling them he is gay. Daniel Kawczynski received a standing ovation when he told 30 activists from Shrewsbury Conservative Association that he had a male partner. Mr Kawczynski, 41, who was born in Poland, has made history as the first MP to make it known that he is bisexual. Shrewsbury Tory chairman Robert Osborne, who was at the meeting, said last night: \u2018It was a very brave thing for Daniel to do and he did it with great aplomb. He received huge support from members of the association and there was never a shadow of doubt that he would. \u2018He made the announcement at the end of the meeting and we moved on straight away.\u2019 Well-placed sources very close to the MP say that although he currently has a male partner,\u00a0 he has not ruled out future relationships with women. The MP feared his decision to \u2018come out\u2019 could prompt a hostile reaction from activists in his constituency in rural Shropshire, with many traditionalist and elderly supporters. He was delighted and relieved by the response when he announced at a meeting: \u2018I want to tell you that I am with a guy.\u2019 Those attending burst into spontaneous cheering and applause. Some hugged Mr Kawczynski; others praised him for his courage and honesty. He is said to feel a huge weight has been lifted from his shoulders. The Mail on Sunday was told by authoritative sources that Mr Kawczynski has candidly stated he is uncertain over the true nature of his sexuality. The MP, popular and respected at Westminster and in his constituency, has told friends: \u2018I don\u2019t know what I am.\u2019 Standing ovation: Mr Kawczynski said he 'feels a weight has been lifted from his shoulders' Until now, he has been best known as the tallest MP in history: at 6ft 8\u00bdin, he towers over his colleagues. Last year, David Cameron gave him his first Government post as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Welsh Secretary David Jones. It is the first rung on the parliamentary ladder to ministerial status. He was recently divorced from his wife, Kate, who worked as his office manager. Catholic Mr Kawczynski is a leading member of the Christian-based, Right-wing Tory Cornerstone group, most of whom are sceptical about gay rights and same-sex marriage. The MP agonised before deciding to vote in favour of same-sex marriages earlier this year. In an unexpected and innovative move, he called a public meeting in his constituency before making his mind up on the issue. He was inundated with hundreds of letters from constituents arguing passionately in favour, or against, the measure. In announcing he would vote in favour of same-sex marriages, he gave a profound and moving insight into his soul-searching on gay rights. In an open letter to voters, he said: \u2018I understand and fully appreciate that there may be many who do not share in my views. Same Sex Marriage vote: Mr Kawczynski called a public meeting in his constituency before making his mind up . My decision however is one of principle which I have come to after a long period\u00a0 of reflection \u2013 I do not believe same-sex marriage will undermine the union of a man and\u00a0 a woman.\u2019 Explaining how his faith guided him, he wrote: \u2018My convictions as a God-fearing man, and as an individual that believes equality for all, have led me to decide that I will vote in favour of the Same Sex Marriage bill. \u2018My faith is essential to everything I do and think. I remember vividly the experiences I had as a child when I was first brought to the church pews:\u00a0 I learned the basic principles of justice, fairness, equality under the eyes of God, and sacrifice and respect for our fellow man. This is an experience which I am sure most of us shared at the beginning of our Christian lives. \u2018When considering voting against same-sex marriage, I realised I could not do so without feeling as if I was at risk of not fulfilling my Christian duties.\u2019 But he continued: \u2018Society has come a long way since homosexual acts were illegal and punishable by law. The age of consent for homosexuals is the same as heterosexuals and gay couples can now adopt. \u2018I cannot call myself a Conservative and a defender of a principle crucial to our national identity if I vote against allowing all who wish to express their love to another to do so through a legally recognised marriage.\u2019 Last night Mr Kawczynski refused to comment.",

    "input": "By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . An ex-gang member who was expelled from school for attempting to kill a fellow pupil has spoken out about the dangers of teen violence and warned that parents need to start taking more responsibility for their children's behaviour. Tracey Miller, 36, spent much of her teens  living a life of crime on the streets of south London, where she grew up and still lives. But several years ago, the mother-of-two got her life back on track and started to work as a mentor for other troubled youths. She went on to co-write a play about the issue and has now released a memoir going into detail about her life of crime in an attempt to deters others from following suit, appearing on This Morning today to tell her story and explaining how easy it is to end up in a gang. Tracey Miller talking about her time in a gang on This Morning . Tracey's destructive attitude started early on, when she was expelled from her senior school after attempting to stab another girl in her class. She was 13 years old and living with her manic-depressive mother three siblings in West Norwood, while her father was facing life in prison. She said: 'The first time I picked up a knife there was a character at home and he was a paedophile. 'I was too scared to tell my mum as she's a manic depressive and she might have killed him. 'Seeing as my dad was incarcerated, there would have been no one else to look after me if I had told her and she had tried to kill him. 'One day I overheard that this man had touched another family member, so I took a knife and put it under my pillow at night.' So the knife was already in her possession when an incident happened with a friend at school that caused tempers to flare. She said: 'People don't understand that when you have a parent who's a manic depressive, it can be quite embarrassing. 'I had taken a friend home and my mum went through a manic episode while she was there. 'This girl went back to school and told everyone and I thought, 'I want to kill her.' 'So I took the knife to school with me and tried to stab her, but the people in my class stopped me, they all jumped on me. 'After that I was expelled.' 'The next school I was sent to was a tough school - it has closed down now. 'They'd already heard of me there because of the knife incident, so I thought I'd carry on with with this reputation. I never intentionally set out to be that character but once I had people at school that took my lead I carried on with it - I got an adrenaline rush from it.' 'It goes to show that children are a by-product of their environment and parents need to be aware of that and take it seriously.' Tracey's behaviour went downhill fast at her new school, she became involved in a gang that would regularly rob local businesses like off licences and even ice cream vans. The situation got so unsafe that she ended up sleeping next to a hand gun every night for protection. But as dangerous as their crimes were, Tracey maintains that gang life nowadays is far more out-of-control. A scene during the Brixton riots in 1995 showing looted shops in Brixton Road . She said: 'The guys I got together with, we targeted businesses. 'A situation like a lady going home from work, doing something like putting a knife against her through and mugging her - hell no, we had morals. 'My generation of gangs set the trend for 'licking it.' 'We'd go into a business, try and get the cash and then get out as quick as we could with no violence. 'Now kids have taken it to a whole new level - with initiations.' The final straw came when she was shot with a sawn-off shotgun during the Brixton Riots in 1995. She said: 'It was the Brixton riots, they were looting the area I was standing in and as we were running, a guy turned and opened fire. 'He had a sawn-off shotgun and it was like the sky just lit up. 'I rolled under a car but it was too late - I'd been shot. Tracey revisits the place where she was shot during the Brixton Riots in 1981 . 'When the crowd dispersed I got up and started to walk away and that's when the pain hit me - it felt like my leg had been torn off and I just collapsed. 'I've still till got ball-bearings lodged in my body. 'The effects of that combined with me getting into a relationship with a man led to me eventually taking an overdose and just losing the momentum for being naughty, that was the change.' Tracey also fell pregnant, prompting her to turn her life around completely. She has spent several years now mentoring troubled young people in various areas of London and also visits Young Offenders Unit in her role. This week she has brought out a her memoirs, called Sour, in a an effort to try and use her story to prevent other people following a similar path. She said: 'There's two ways of looking at it - if I hadn't done that then I couldn't mentor the people that I do now, but equally\u00a0I could have done something better with my life like be a brain surgeon maybe. 'I'd rather I hadn't done what I did, but it is what it is. 'I don't want sympathy, this is just a story that I felt needed to be told. 'This is to convince other youngsters to come out and tell their story, or to convince them to change their paths. 'People need to be told that there are no grey areas in life, it's black or white - you know what's right or wrong. 'As for parents - they are your children. So if your kids are coming back with stuff that you know you haven't given them, inspect their rooms, look through their phones, connect with them.'",

    "input": "Misting machines were introduced on the fresh produce counters at Morrisons to create an impression of freshness. Everything from lettuces to loose tomatoes were constantly sprayed with fine droplets of water, giving the idea they had just arrived, fresh out of the ground. The resulting fog was part of the \u2018retail theatre\u2019 introduced by chief executive, Dalton Philips, who arrived from running a retail chain in Canada to spread a little magic over Morrisons and its sales. The misters keeping this asparagus fresh are soon to be a thing of the past at Morrisons . The machines are to go, despite having been installed in some 300 Morrisons supermarkets . However, it seems they were a little too fancy for customers of Morrisons, which has decided to pull down the curtain on this particular show. Mr Philips was ousted last month following a vicious campaign from an old guard of company executives, including Sir Ken Morrison, the former chairman and son of the founder of the chain. Traditionally, Morrisons, which was founded in Bradford in 1899, built the layout of its stores around the theme of a street market with green grocer, butcher and baker. The set-up appealed to customers in the north, where the brand is strong, who had a reputation for being careful with their money. Consequently, the decision to bring in the misting machines, which has since been copied by some other stores, was something of a surprise. Now, after spending a large sum of money installing the machines in some 300 of the chain\u2019s supermarkets, the new management at Morrisons have decided to get rid of them. It is not a moment too soon for Sir Ken, who has long argued the machines highlighted how Mr Philips had alienated core shoppers, many of whom have switched to budget rivals Aldi and Lidl. One of Mr Philips\u2019s biggest critics, Roger Owen, a former long-serving main board director, has been lobbying the company\u2019s chairman, Andy Higginson, to get rid of the machines. \u2018You don\u2019t need misting. It is a waste of money, a waste of time and it does carry a risk unless you spend a significant amount on maintenance,\u2019 he said. \u2018I said one of the first things Andy Higginson should do is take it out, which he obviously has done and good on him. Former Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips was ousted last month and now his misters are to go too . \u2018If this is an indicator of his intention that he has already spoken about of getting the business back to its core values and core strengths, then this is a step in the right direction and a very, very visible one.\u2019 Morrisons\u2019 group retail director Martyn Fletcher told staff about the decision to dump the misting machines earlier this week. A spokesman said: \u2018This move is about going back to basics, using simpler refrigeration techniques and Morrisons\u2019 traditional strengths in fresh food management to ensure our vegetables stay fresh.\u2019 Morrisons did not actually fare too badly in recent sales figures compared to rivals . The U-turn represents an end to what has been dubbed the \u2018war of fog\u2019 between Mr Philips and his detractors. The former chief executive has always proudly defended the misting machines, which were used particularly in the South East, where stores attract a more middle class shopper. He gave an interview to Retail Week last month saying: \u2018I will refute until my last day about taking the stores upmarket, we did not do that. 'There are parts of the south of England which I think have benefitted from the slightly different assortment and I don\u2019t regret that. \u2018Misty veg is in our competitors now. The most important thing is whether our customers liked it or not.\u2019 The misting machines were part of a radical make-over for the Morrisons chain carried out by Mr Philips, who became chief executive in 2010. He also introduced an online shopping service and began opening small convenience stores to tap into changing shopping habits. This week, industry sales figures were released suggesting his radical ideas were beginning to bear fruit, however the improvement came too late to save Mr Philips and his job. Figures from Kantar Worldpanel show sales were down by 0.4per cent over the past 12 weeks compared to the same period last year. This was the best performance by the chain for a year and much better than Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s.",

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, she adds: 'It was often applied to women who suffered from depression or exhaustion brought on by impossible circumstances. 'Zelda did suffer from some mental health crises - depression, primarily - and was an uninhibited, uncensored woman who didn't always think before she acted but she wasn't crazy. 'Unwise? Sometimes. Insane? No.' Fowler also goes on to rubbish the myth that The Great Gatsby's Daisy Buchanan is synonymous with Zelda, instead arguing that although there are some commonalities and F. Scott borrowed heavily from Zelda's diaries, the two were not the same. Tragic: Both Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald died young, although their daughter had a long, happy life . Fame: The Great Gatsby painted a decadent picture of 1920s New York and made F. Scott Fitzgerald's name . Born in 1900, Zelda was the youngest daughter of Alabama Supreme Court Justice, Anthony Sayre and his wife, Minnie Machen Sayre. She met her future husband at a dance in 1918 but was told not to get involved with him by her parents who thought the young F. Scott Fitzgerald entirely unsuitable. Defying her parents, Zelda continued to see F. Scott and the couple married just before her 20th birthday. The pair left to live in New York, the setting for many of Fitzgerald's most famous novels, and at the beginning of the Roaring Twenties, a glitteringly decadent place to be. The 1920s was the beginning of a social revolution, which saw women emerge from the home and join men in bars and nightclubs unchaperoned and unfettered by the mores of the Victorian era. Women smoking and drinking became a common sight, as did seeing them dance with abandon and engaging in casual relationships. Even skirts got shorter, with the austere full length skirts and high necked blouses of wartime giving way to sparkling, beaded flapper dresses. The older generation were scandalised but for Zelda and her new husband, it was just what the doctor ordered. Decadent: The glittering world of The Great Gatsby will be brought back to life in Baz Lurhman's 2013 film . Scandalous: The behaviour of young flappers such as these was viewed with horror by the older generation . They quickly became doyennes of the New York social scene but it wasn't enough for Fitzgerald, who didn't just want to be famous, but rich and brilliant as well. For her part, says Fowler, Zelda was desperate for him to succeed in every way. After their daughter, Scottie, was born in 1921, the pair moved to France, so Fitzgerald could concentrate on his writing. But although the pair enjoyed some success during this period, the Fitzgeralds' peripatetic lifestyle and passionate marriage began to take its toll. By this point, Zelda had begun her own literary career, penning a semi-autobiographical novel called Save Me the Waltz, which lifted the lid on her rocky marriage. F. Scott was furious, saying their life together was 'his material'. He was also drinking heavily, which led to increasingly violent rows. It was now, says Therese, that both their lives began to spiral inexorably out of control. Estranged through the later years of their marriage, F. Scott spent his twilight years in Hollywood attempting to forge a career in screen writing and pursuing an affair with movie columnist, Sheilah Graham. He died, aged 44, of a heart attack in 1940. He hadn't seen his wife, who outlived him by eight years, for more than 18 months. Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler is published on the 11th April by Hodder & Stoughton.",

The uncle and long-time coach to 14-time grand slam champion Rafa Nadal is in hot water after serving up some controversial comments on Spain's new Davis Cup captain, Gala Leon Garcia. Garcia, who was announced as successor to Carlos Moya earlier this week, is the first female to captain Spain's men's team. She is the fifth woman to coach a Davis Cup side, according to the International Tennis Federation. But Nadal thinks appointing the 40-year-old -- whose highest ranking as a player was 27th -- could pose problems, not least in the locker room. \"In no way am I sexist,\" Nadal told Spanish radio station Cadena SER on Tuesday. \"You could brand me old-fashioned in seeing problems about having to share a dressing room with a woman, but to go from there to talking about sexism ... Would I be OK with peeing in front of a woman? No way. That in any case might be old-fashioned.\" Comfort breaks aren't the only issue, according to Nadal. \"A woman is just as capable as a man, but men's and women's tennis are different sports,\" he argued. \"I know nothing about the hours and training systems for women's tennis. I don't even know who the best players are. I doubt Gala Leon knows the (men's) world number 40 ...\" Nadal, 53, was responding after his initial comments on the subject aired on Monday caused a bit of a stir. In a interview with on RNE, Spain's national radio station, Nadal initially suggested it \"might be easier for the captain to be a man,\" before addressing the issue of the locker room for the first time. \"I believe she doesn't know the players, at least Rafael, and there is a logistical difficulty that is difficult to solve, because in the Davis Cup a lot of time is spent in locker rooms without much clothing and with a woman it would always be weird.\" But some players who may play under Garcia appear unfazed by the prospect. \"I don't think the fact she is a woman affects anything,\" doubles specialist Marc Lopez said, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported. \"The players have to accept it, to be united, to play, win and go up to the World Group,\" the 32-year-old added. \"There are several rooms ... it's not essential that she is there where you're having a shower. It will be a bit different, but I don't think whether she can or can't be there all the time will influence the development of her work.\" Britain's Andy Murray, who appointed former women's world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo as his coach in June, was supportive of Garcia's appointment. Murray's recent tweet about Scottish independence might have been controversial but few would have disagreed with his views on the vote of confidence in Garcia by Spain's Davis Cup bosses. \"Congrats to Gala Leon Garcia for becoming first female Spanish Davis cup captain today... hopefully first of many!\" Murray tweeted. Spain has dominated the Davis Cup in the early 21st century, winning the team tournament five times since 2000, but has struggled in recent times. In September, Spain was relegated from the World Group for the first time since 1996 after losing 3-1 to Brazil. The wrist injury that kept Rafa Nadal out of the U.S. Open also precluded his involvement in Spain's defeat in Sao Paulo, but the world No. 2 is expected to return to action at next week's China Open in Beijing.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick lifted a state of emergency Thursday, one day after blizzard conditions pounded his state and created hazardous travel conditions across New England. Hundreds of schools remained closed in Massachusetts as crews continued to clear snow and to salt icy roadways, according to state Emergency Management spokesman Peter Judge. The state's 250 National Guardsmen -- who were mobilized as a precautionary measure on Wednesday -- were relieved from duty by Thursday morning, Judge said. Delta Air Lines canceled more than 200 Delta and Delta Connection flights in an effort to minimize delays, the airline said. It had canceled 1,300 flights Wednesday because of the storm. Amtrak, which had suspended rail service between New York City and points north, resumed full service by Thursday morning, according to Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole. Officials said snow accumulation in scattered areas across Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont reached up to 30 inches, while most areas received between 8 and 16 inches of snow. Snowfall in the heaviest areas reached rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Some residents in Brattleboro, Vermont, donned cross-country skis as they traveled down snow-jammed roads, while their neighbors heaved shovelfuls of snow out of driveways and sidewalks, said town resident Caleb Clark. By Thursday, some 1,500 households remained without electricity in Massachusetts, according to the National Grid utility company's website. Tens of thousands of residents had lost power Wednesday evening when high winds and fallen trees knocked out transmission-lines. The hardest-hit areas included Plymouth, Bristol, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts, the utility company said. \"This is the second major storm we are battling in less than three weeks,\" said Christopher E. Root, National Grid senior vice president of electricity operations. \"We ask that our customers bear with us and be patient as our crews work in challenging weather conditions to restore service as safely and quickly as possible.\" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said only 30 vehicles had been towed as a result of the storm. That number is in stark contrast to the thousands of cars, buses and ambulances left stranded last month after cleanup crews struggled to plow streets days after the storm. Bloomberg, who faced sharp criticism over the slow emergency response, said New York was better equipped to tackle Wednesday's storm. More than 1,700 flights were canceled at the New York area's three major airports, while hundreds more were grounded at Boston's Logan International Airport, officials said. The general manager at LaGuardia Airport, Thomas Bosco, said many airlines pre-emptively canceled flights ahead of the weather to avoid massive delays that plagued airports during last month's holiday blizzard. The storm swept into the Northeast after dumping unusually heavy snow across the South. Every U.S. state except Florida has snow on the ground, including Hawaii, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. In Atlanta, Mayor Kasim Reed pledged city streets will be able to handle weekend crowds at several downtown events, including the NFC divisional playoff game Saturday evening at the Georgia Dome. \"The administration, in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Transportation and private contractors, have worked aggressively to clear roads and ensure the safety and welfare of Atlanta residents,\" his office said in a statement Thursday. Reed came under criticism for the city's planned response to the snow, which arrived Sunday night. The city expanded its fleet of snow response equipment from 10 pieces to 58 Tuesday. By Thursday, more than 115 vehicles were clearing the effects of the largest snow event in at least a decade.",

A speaker drew applause from mourners at the funeral of a district attorney and his wife who were shot dead, when he said of their killers: 'Chase 'em down. Go get 'em. Bring 'em to justice... Take them out of the hole they come from.' Chris Heisler made the remarks as he led an emotional memorial service on Thursday for Mike and Cynthia McLelland who were murdered in their Texas home near Forney last Saturday. Loved ones remembered the couple's love, warmth and public service as police continue to hunt for their killers. Dozens of law enforcement officers and . public officials, including Texas Governor Rick Perry, were among the . hundreds who attended the service. Scroll down for video . Grief: Shirley Woodward, mother of Cynthia McLelland, holds a flag after a memorial service for her daughter and son-in-law DA Mike McLelland on Thursday. The couple were shot dead on Saturday at their home in Texas . Honored: An image of Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia is unveiled beside their coffin at a memorial service in Mesquite, Texas on Thursday . According to CNN, an affidavit on Thursday revealed further details of the investigations into the couple's deaths. Friends reportedly found the bodies of the DA and his wife after going to their home on Saturday evening, having not heard from them in almost 24 hours. They were found with multiple gunshot wounds. Police have requested phone records for the McLellands for the last two months to see if more can be discovered about the days leading up to the fatal attack. At their funeral service on Thursday, Mr and Mrs McLelland shared a single, flag-draped casket inside the suburban church. McLelland had addressed many of the . same people two months earlier, after the slaying of Mark Hasse, one of . his prosecutors. Hasse was gunned down near the Kaufman County . courthouse while going to work. The deaths are feared to be planned attacks by violent white supremacist gang, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. McLelland was pivotal in the prosecution of a senior member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas last year who received two life terms following a shoot out. No arrests have been made in either case. The reward for information leading to a conviction has been doubled to $200,000. Mrs McLelland's remains were cremated and placed inside the coffin with the body of her husband, the Kaufman County district attorney. Friends and colleagues at the service described the couple as the perfect mismatch: an outgoing Army veteran known for his wit and humor, and a quieter partner who loved quilting and supported her husband's work. Christina Foreman, one of the five children the couple shared, said both her mother and stepfather 'loved . every minute' of their public service. She challenged the audience to . stand up for what they believe in. Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow on Saturday . Tragic day: An honor guard moves the remains of of the murdered couple. Police are still hunting for their killer . Sorrow: Texas Governor Rick Perry takes a flag to present to the family of Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia. He added $100,000 to the reward for finding the couple's killer . Ms Foreman said:' They would have done it exactly the same way, because Mike believed in making a difference.' Bruce Bryant, chief investigator for the district attorney's office, broke down in tears as he remembered his former boss. 'We will not stop pursuing justice,' Mr Bryant said. 'We will not give up the good fight. We will not stop doing God's work. We will pause only to celebrate the lives of those we have lost, but we will not stop.' Surrounding the McLellands' casket were mementos of their life together - portraits, a soldier's jacket from Mike McLelland's Army service and a quilt to commemorate one of Cynthia's favorite hobbies. Two officers stood watch as dozens more sat in the audience. Officers in the balcony behind the stage could be seen raising white-gloved hands to their eyes during the service. Governor Perry said he had spoken to McLelland weeks earlier at the state Capitol in Austin. Perry credited both McLellands for their public service - Mike as a 20-year Army veteran and district attorney and Cynthia as a nurse who worked at a state hospital. Perry said both were aware of the dangers of the district attorney's job. Final salute: A police officer salutes as mourners file one-by-one past the remains of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia . Emotional tribute: Texas Governor Rick Perry spoke of the couple's public service as hundreds attended a memorial today . 'It's an art form. It's a calling, and one of the more difficult ones, I imagine,' Perry said in a quiet, sometimes halting voice. Perry later presented Mrs McLelland's mother Shirley Woodward with the flag which she clasped close to her. Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood, the county's chief administrative official, said he got to know Mike McLelland while the two were campaigning for office three years ago. 'I knew immediately how intelligent he was,' Wood said. 'But he was quite a character too.' Friends remembered Mike ribbing a pastor about the length of his sermons and Cynthia repeatedly going back to one store to buy gifts for relatives and friends. They also recalled Mike running a tough campaign for district attorney - and his drive to prosecute criminals and pursue justice. 'If Cynthia was all warmth and motherhood, Mike was a warrior,' Bryant said. Distraught: Flags fly at half-staff at the Kaufman County Law Enforcement Center as the small Texas community mourned the murders of the district attorney and his wife . In the months after Hasse was killed, McLelland began to carry a gun everywhere and took extra caution when answering his door. He told The Associated Press in an interview shortly before his death that he was warning his employees that they needed to be more cautious as well. 'The people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more in the future'. Several people on Thursday remembered that spirit of persistence and defiance. Standing in front of the casket, Foreman told the audience they had a responsibility not to let fear stop them from fighting to do right thing. She said she believed her mother and stepfather had prepared her for this moment, when she and her siblings must go on without them. 'The right thing is never easy,' Foreman said. She added: 'And he knew that. And he stood up anyway.'",

The Prime Minister was yesterday left embarrassed after facing questions about the fact the upmarket leather goods firm employing his wife is based in a tax haven. It comes after it emerged that Smythson is owned through a holding company in Luxembourg and linked to a secretive trust in Guernsey, another tax haven. The leather goods and luxury stationer, which has a store on New Bond Street that sells \u00a32,000 python-skin handbags, has employed Samantha Cameron as a part-time creative consultant since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to \u00a3100,000 a year. At Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, asked: \u2018Does the Prime Minister know of anyone who owns or works for a UK-registered company that uses a Luxembourg-based holding company in order to avoid paying their fair share of tax in the UK?\u2019 Mr Cameron ignored the implied reference to his wife, saying: \u2018We inherited a situation where company after company was leaving our shores.

Since Bahbout bought the business, the holding company Holdsmyth has paid around \u00a31.06 million in corporation tax. But over the same period, \u00a31 million in dividends paid out may have benefited from the tax status of Guernsey and Luxembourg. Controversy over its tax affairs has been more intense because the company has previously borrowed \u00a32 million under the National Loan Guarantee Scheme, a taxpayer-backed initiative for banks to provide small firms with cheap finance, and it currently has a \u00a35 million credit facility which is classed as \u2018state aid\u2019.

    "input": "A couple who had been trying for a baby for almost a decade are celebrating the birth of quadruplet girls following a pregnancy that made medical history. Doctors were stunned when four babies of the same sex developed after a single embryo was implanted in the pair\u2019s first attempt at IVF. And after nine years of longing to start a family, proud parents Christine and Justin Clark suddenly have a rather substantial one. Christine and Justin Clark tried for a baby unsuccessfully for nine years before having quads Darcy, Caroline, Elisha and Alexis after IVF treatment . A single fertilised embryo was implanted - so doctors were stunned when four babies developed, and medics said it was unheard of for four children of the same sex to be born from a single embryo . The babies are now seven weeks old, . doing well in hospital and likely to be allowed to go home next month, . when the whirlwind of sleepless nights and feeding will kick in. Dr Geetha Venkat, Director of the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, told MailOnline that if the babies are all from the same IVF embryo then they will all be identical. She explained that if they are not identical then some of the babies must have been conceived naturally within a few days of the IVF embryo being implanted. She believes that the presence of two placentas makes this the more likely explanation. She said that in 20 years of working with IVF treatment she has never before come across quads being born following the implanting of just one embryo. She said: 'This is a very interesting case because it is very rare.' But the Clarks, from Rotherham, are . simply overjoyed at their luck \u2013 with the odds of having quads from one . embryo estimated at more than two million to one. The babies had a combined weight of . just over 10lb when they were born at the Jessop Hospital in Sheffield . on March 25. Darcy weighed 2lb, followed\u00a0 by Caroline at 2lb 3oz, Elisha . at 2lb 14oz and Alexis at 3lb. Mr Clark, a lorry driver, said: \u2018The girls are all doing well. Now we can\u2019t wait to get them home.\u2019 He added that the couple were on the verge of giving up hope of a baby when they decided to try IVF. Just one embryo was implanted \u2013 and Mrs Clark, 36, found out she was pregnant only three weeks later. An initial scan suggested triplets, . but a second revealed four babies. Mr Clark, 43, said: \u2018It was very . emotional. We were happy, but worried about the logistics.\u2019 The pregnancy also proved difficult as Mrs Clark, a nurse, suffered from extreme morning sickness. The babies weighed 10lb in total and were born when Mrs Clark was 30 weeks pregnant . The girls were born at Sheffield's Jessop Hospital, and are now being cared for in the special care baby unit at Rotherham Hospital, close to their parents' home . She was admitted to hospital at 24 . weeks because she was breathless, but doctors kept her stable until 30 . weeks before delivering the four babies by caesarean. Experts believe the single embryo split into three before one of these split again, resulting in qudruplets. The couple hope to take all four babies, who were born on March 25, home in June . Adel Shaker of CARE Sheffield, who . carried out the fertility treatment, said: \u2018I have been working in IVF . for over 20 years and this is the first case I am aware of where a . single embryo transferred resulted in a quadruplet pregnancy. \u2018Previous IVF quadruplets have seen babies from both sexes and were reported after transferring two embryos at least.\u2019 Darcy was first born at 2.46pm weighing . 2lbs, Caroline followed also at 2.46pm weighing 2lbs 3oz, Elisha was . born at 2.47pm weighing 2lbs 14oz and the last was Alexis, born weighing . 3lbs at 2.48pm. Mr Clark, 43, said he and his wife . had been able to take the biggest, Alexis, out of the special unit and . added: \u2018It was the first time either of us had pushed a pram.\u2019 The parents said three weeks after the single embryo was implanted, a pregnancy test confirmed Mrs Clark was pregnant. The . 36-year-old said: \u2018When we found out we were having four babies, I just . couldn\u2019t believe it. I was speechless and to be honest, I didn\u2019t . believe it until I saw them for myself.\u2019 Mr . Clark said: \u2018They are the first set of quads to be born from a single . embryo, which then split into three. One of these three then split into . two, to make twins. \u2018On . the birth of the children there were two placentas so we\u2019re not sure . yet if we have two babies and the twins, or triplets and a singleton. \u2018Tests will have to be carried out when they are 10 to 12 weeks old to confirm this.\u2019 During the pregnancy, Mrs Clark suffered from extreme morning sickness - known as hyperemesis gravidarum. She said: \u2018When the news came out . about Kate Middleton, I knew exactly what she was going through. It . didn\u2019t stop until 27 weeks and it was exhausting. \u2018I felt sick all the time, and I was tired and lethargic.

Burgled: Mike Tyson, pictured here starring in The Hangover as himself, was sleeping when the intruder broke in to his hotel suite . A tip-toeing intruder has been dubbed the world's bravest (or most stupid) burglar - after he broke into Mike Tyson's hotel room as the ex-boxer was sleeping. The raider fled the suite at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas after Iron Mike, infamous for biting off an opponent's ear in a bout, woke to the sound of rustling. It was a lucky escape for the thief, who could have been on the end of Tyson's powerful right hook had the heavyweight been fully alert. Nothing was taken in the break-in and security at the resort, where top suites cost up to $1,500 per night, has now been stepped up. Knock-out Hollywood actor Tyson, who floored a burglar as he played himself in The Hangover film after his tiger was stolen, was staying at the hotel with his family on New Year's Eve after attending a Stevie Wonder concert. The TMZ website reported: 'We're told Tyson was sleeping like a baby when all of a sudden, he awoke to rustling sounds and saw a flashlight. 'But by the time Iron Mike realized what was happening, the intruder had already run out of the room.' A hotel spokesman added: 'We have received a report of an incident that is currently under investigation. As always, guest safety is of the utmost importance.' The run-in with the sleepy pugilistic pigeon-fancier, who raises the racing variety of the bird in his spare time, should be considered a lucky escape.

The former boxing champion, 45, was jailed for three years in 1992 for raping a beauty pageant contestant in Indianapolis. Several years later, he spent three months in jail for beating up two men after a minor car crash in suburban Washington.

Local health authorities in China warned the situation was \"severe,\" with six deaths and 21,527 infections recorded in Guangdong province in southern China by Sunday. Elsewhere in Asia, Malaysia and Taiwan have reported more cases and deaths in 2014 than in previous years, and Japan has seen more than 150 infections in its first outbreak of the tropical disease since 1945, according to news agency Kyodo. And a new study released this week found that dengue cases in India may be 300 times the number officially reported. The disease costs the country at least $548 million a year. Hot and cold . The outbreak in China is spreading quickly, with more than 1,000 new cases found each day last week. In some hospitals, hundreds of patients stream in daily complaining of dengue-like symptoms. \"I feel very hot on the skin, but cold inside my body,\" one man told CCTV, China's state television. The viral disease is also called \"breakbone fever\" because of the severe muscle and joint pain it causes. There's no approved vaccine or specific drug to treat dengue, which is not usually fatal but lands many victims in hospitals. Chinese authorities say recent hot and wet weather fueled the outbreak, with mosquito numbers up five fold. After a week-long national holiday, authorities are now scrambling to fumigate mosquito breeding sites with pesticide. Residents in the city of Guangzhou are being offered free mosquito repellent. The World Health Organization lists dengue fever as a \"neglected disease\" and estimates that there may be 50 to 100 million dengue infections worldwide each year. However, research published last year suggested that around 390 million people are infected each year -- more than triple the WHO's estimate. Spread by a type of of mosquito (Aedes aegypti), the disease thrives in tropical mega cities like Guangzhou thanks to rapid urbanization and population movement. Climate change is also a factor, giving rise to longer periods that infected mosquitos can survive. CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Something didn't look right. David Henneberry had been cooped up for hours, stuck inside as police searched for a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. He ventured out for some fresh air after police lifted their order to stay indoors. He looked at the boat parked in his yard. What he saw brought an end to the authorities' sweeping manhunt. It would lead them to a fugitive, who was hiding on the floor of his boat. \"The tarp on his winterized boat had sort of been flapping in the wind,\" his stepson Robert Duffy told CNN's Piers Morgan. 'A million questions' for suspect . Henneberry had tied down the covering on the vessel in his backyard so firmly that it had not budged all winter long, not even through this year's blizzards. \"He got closer and realized that one of the retention straps had literally been cut -- not chafed, not broken or unhooked,\" Duffy said. Henneberry saw something else -- something on the tarp that looked like blood. The Watertown resident thought some animal had forced its way into his boat. Maybe it was a squirrel, he told his stepson. Henneberry climbed a stepladder to look inside. \"He basically stuck his head under the tarp (and) noticed a pool of blood,\" Duffy said. WATCH: 5 days in 3 minutes . 'Crumpled up in a ball' It was dark under the tarpaulin, so the boat owner could only make out vague contours, \"but he definitely noticed there was something crumpled up in a ball,\" the stepson said. A pool of blood; a manhunt in Watertown; time to call 911. Squad cars with lights flashing raced in and lined the streets. Officers fanned out around the house. Police whisked the Henneberrys so hastily from harm's way and into a neighbor's house that the couple left their cell phones behind at home. Brothers hoped to start new life in U.S. Frantic phone calls . Duffy said he tried frantically to call his mother and stepfather as he watched on TV while law officers unleashed a hailstorm of gunfire into the backyard. \"We only saw the bullets; we only heard that there was a man covered in blood in the boat.\" His stepfather, Duffy thought. He kept dialing. As Boston reeled, younger suspect partied . The couple's landline gave him a constant busy signal. \"It was absolutely horrifying for approximately 40 minutes,\" Duffy said. He drove over to a relative's house to see if the phone lines worked better from there. As soon as he arrived, his sister called him. \"Mom's called, they're safe,\" she comforted him. \"At that point, my tears of horror went to tears of joy,\" Duffy said. WATCH: Final moments of standoff . An end to the hunt . Henneberry's call to police put an end to the hunt for the man suspected of planting one of two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and inflicting injuries on dozens more that are typical of wounds sustained in conflict regions such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Before police stopped him, Dzhokar Tsarnaev, with his older brother, Tamerlan, allegedly shot a university policeman dead, hijacked a car at gunpoint, then fired upon and threw grenades at officers pursuing them. Police shot and killed the brother, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev eluded them all day Friday -- until Henneberry's 911 call. Before opening fire, authorities, using a bullhorn, called on the younger Tsarnaev to surrender. A standoff followed. When it finally ended and police approached the boat, they were aware of the danger the armed man posed. Unlike Henneberry, they used a robot to pull back the tarp over the boat. Relief in Boston; grief still remains .",

The terror-group has demanded a $6.6million ransom for the woman, as well as the release of imprisoned neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, ABC News reports. The hostage's family has asked for her name not to be released for fear of her safety. \u00a0She is the third of at least four hostages held by ISIS, including executed photojournalist James Foley. Scroll down for video . Demands: ISIS has demanded a $6.6million ransom for a female American aid worker held hostage. The group shocked the world last week when they posted a graphic video (screen grab above) showing the beheading of captive James Foley, an American photojournalist . In exchange: ISIS is also demanding the release of neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui. The ransom was confirmed by a spokesman for Siddiqui's family, who are trying to distance themselves from the group . Another hostage: The group has threatened to kill American journalist Steven Sotloff next . News of the ransom comes just a week after the group beheaded Foley in a savage propaganda video posted online. At the end of the video, the group threatened to kill another hostage, journalist Steven Sotloff, next. The ransom was revealed Monday, at a press conference held on behalf of Siddiqui's family, who are trying to distance themselves from ISIS. It was also confirmed through a close friend of the unidentified hostage's family. The group previously asked for the released of Siddiqui when they sent Foley's family a $132million ransom request before his execution. Siddiqui, an MIT-trained neuroscientist, was convicted in 2010 of trying to kill U.S. officials. Authorities believe she may have also been planning to construction dirty bombs to be used in terrorist attacks. Her family has released a statement saying they have no connections to ISIS and that 'associating Aafia's name with acts of violence is against everything we are struggling for'. 'While we deeply appreciate the sincere feelings of those who, like us, wish to see the freedom of our beloved Aafia, we cannot agree with a \"by any means necessary\" approach to Aafia\u2019s freedom. 'Nor can we accept that someone else\u2019s daughter or sister suffer like Aafia is suffering,' the letter says. Foley's ransom was not paid because the U.S. and Britain do not negotiate with terrorists . ISIS has taken hostage several other Western Europeans, some of which were able to secure release when their respective countries paid the ransoms. Collecting ransoms is the main way terrorist organizations fund their activities, and a New York Times report revealed that Al Qaeda (which has distanced themselves from ISIS) collected an estimated $125million in ransoms from European governments in the last five years.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki is known as one of the fittest players in tennis, but even the rejuvenated Dane is feeling anxious as she prepares to take part in the New York City Marathon in early November. Wozniacki admits to having nightmares about the grueling 26.2-mile race, which comes just a week after the season-ending WTA Finals conclude in Singapore. \"I dreamed one time that before I even got to the start line I was dead,\" Wozniacki laughs during an interview with CNN's Open Court. \"Or I dreamed that someone had to get me through the finish line in a wheelchair. \"So I don't know if I am that confident but I'm starting to get there. I definitely have a finish goal in mind but I want to keep it to myself.\" Wozniacki is competing in the marathon for charity, capping a rollercoaster 2014 in which the former world No. 1 suffered an array of injuries and a high-profile split with top golfer Rory McIlroy before making her first grand slam final in five years at the U.S. Open. She then continued her resurgence with good form on the WTA Tour's Asian swing, clinching a place at the elite eight-woman championships for the first time since 2011. \"The running has definitely helped,\" she says. \"In the middle of the year I had a tough time outside the court and in my personal life. \"Just going for a run was nice to clear my mind and think about something else. Then you feel great about yourself as well. You get fit.\" Still, if you think Wozniacki is crazy for deciding to take part this year after tennis' tiring 10-month hop around the world, you aren't alone. Her dad and fitness coach both thought the same. \"They said, 'You are crazy,' \" Wozniacki says. And while two-time grand slam winner Andy Murray plans to one day run a marathon, he won't do it until he is retired. \"That's an amazing effort, she's doing that while playing, because it takes a lot of training, a lot of hard work,\" he told reporters in Cincinnati in August. Wozniacki brought up the idea during a grass-court tournament in Eastbourne, England in June, where her career revival began. \"I was sitting there with my dad and my team and I was like, 'Hey, I'm going to run the New York City Marathon' and my dad was like, 'No you are not,' \" says Wozniacki, now ranked ninth. \"So I made the phone call right there and then to my agent John (Tobias) and I said, 'John, look up charities I can run for.' \"He was like, 'Funny joke' and I said, 'It's not a joke, I'm serious.' He came with a list that evening and I checked them out.\" Wozniacki eventually settled on Team for Kids, which according to the New York Road Runners' website, provides \"free low-cost health and fitness programs to kids who would otherwise have little or no access to regular physical activity.\" Sports has always been an important part of the Wozniacki family, with dad Piotr a former pro footballer, mom Anna a former volleyball player and brother Patrik also into football in Denmark. Running a marathon had always been on her \"bucket list,\" too, although it seems unlikely that Wozniacki would have participated this year had she and McIlroy not gone their separate ways. It was McIlroy who broke off the engagement. They were reportedly due to wed in November -- in New York. Wozniacki has stepped up her training while maintaining a full tennis schedule -- prior to losing to Serena Williams in last month's final at Flushing Meadows she told reporters how she believed it had helped her on-court fitness. She has run a half-marathon and through tennis may be equipped to deal with the \"mental battle\" faced by distance runners. \"I know the marathon is breathing down my neck so I know I need to get out and run and it's great for me,\" she says. \"I love it. \"I think running a marathon is very mental. It's definitely a mental battle with yourself out there and I think that's the same on the tennis court. \"Sometimes you are hitting the wall out there and you can't seem to get the points together but you just need to keep focusing, take one point at a time and somehow you manage to turn it around. I think it's the same in the marathon.\" Her reward when she gets to the finish line? \"I told my friends and my manager to have chocolate and some sweets waiting for me,\" she said. \"We are definitely going to go out for a very unhealthy dinner afterwards.\"",

    "input": "Pensioners in Britain are more likely to die of flu or pneumonia than anywhere else in Europe, a damning Brussels report has revealed. Official figures show more than 80 Britons die from the diseases every day \u2013 70 per cent higher than the European average. Overall, some 138 people in every 100,000 in the UK die from \u2018respiratory diseases\u2019 \u2013 including influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma \u2013 every three years. This works out at 88,000 people \u2013 or 29,000 a year. Britain has the worst record in Europe for deaths from respiratory diseases like flu and pneumonia . Nine out of 10 people who die from flu and other respiratory diseases are over 65, according to the EU report \u2013 suggesting some 26,000 British pensioners die from the preventable diseases every year. The EU said poor public health campaigns warning the elderly to get vaccinated against flu was to blame for countries suffering high death rates. In 2011 the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley scrapped the annual flu vaccination advertising campaign to encourage pensioners to get the jab. After a spike in deaths the Department of Health u-turned \u2013 reintroducing the yearly campaign. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: \u2018These figures are deeply worrying and shows us just how far there is to go to get care right for older people with poor respiratory health or at high risk from infections such as the flu. \u2018It is vital we ensure the health service is geared up to meet the needs of frail older people and those living with long term conditions and help them stay as well as possible especially as winter approaches.\u2019 Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s Shadow Health Minister, said old age deaths because they could not afford to heat their homes was a national scandal. Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain . Heat your home to at least 18C . If heating the whole house is a problem heat the living room during the day and your bedroom just before you go to sleep . Have your flu jab to protect yourself  from influenza . Look out for friends, relatives and neighbours who may be vulnerable to the cold . Watch the weather forecast and plan ahead . Have regular hot meals and drinks . Get financial support to make your home more energy efficient . Have your heating and cooking appliances checked regularly . Wear a few layers of thin clothing rather than one thick layer . When you need to go outside wear shoes with slip resistant, good grip soles . Mr Gwynne said: \u2018Older people living in cold homes is a scandal and we must put an end to it. \u2018Labour's promise to stand up to the energy companies and freeze bills will help to protect older people from poor health.\u2019 Former industrial areas and countries where lots of people smoke are also likely to suffer higher flu and pneumonia death rates. The Brussels report said men were almost twice as likely to die from the diseases. Public Health England confirmed that Britain was the worst record for flu and pneumonia in Europe according to Brussels' official figures. Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at PHE, said: 'Although attempts are made to standardise coding of deaths, it\u2019s important to exercise caution when comparing country to country figures like this, due to systematic differences in the way clinicians complete death certificates. 'While these figures suggest UK has a high rate of respiratory death, it also says UK has one of the lowest rates for circulatory deaths, and it is not possible to conclude from these figures alone that the UK has had a higher burden of disease due to influenza' The Government was attacked earlier this week over official advice for pensioners to protect against the cold this winter. The Public Health England document said struggling pensioners should only turn on the heating in one room to stay warm this winter. The new guidance urges those struggling to pay their heating bills to only warm their living room during the day and their bedroom at night. A hot water bottle should also be taken to bed, according to Public Health England. Other 'top tips' to drive down winter deaths include wearing slippers, keeping out the cold with lots of thin layers of clothes \u2013 and having regular hot meals and cups of tea throughout the day. According to the report the elderly should heat their homes to at least 18C during the winter to protect their health. Last year's cold weather saw 31,100 excess deaths in Britain, mainly among over\u201375s. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) and his Labour opposite number Andy Burnham (right) clashed in the Commons over the NHS today, amid warnings that the health service needs \u00a38billion more funding . Dot Gibson, National Pensioners' Convention general secretary, said: 'Every year, we get the same sort of message from public health officials. But the number of older people dying from cold\u2013related illnesses is on the rise. 'Putting on an extra jumper or walking around a bit more than usual doesn't really address the fact that fuel bills continue to go up way in excess of people's pensions. 'Warm words are nice \u2013 but a warm home is better.' The average household energy bill is now \u00a31,265 a year, \u00a353 more than a year ago. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, added: 'It is shocking that each winter an older person dies every seven minutes from cold weather. 'Turning up the heating is not an option for many older people struggling with high bills.' But Dr Angie Bone, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at Public Health England, said thousands of lives could be saved if people followed the Government's advice. The flu jab is available every year on the NHS to protect adults and some children, at risk. Flu can be an unpleasant illness. But for those who are otherwise healthy, it usually clears up on its own within a week. However, for some people the illness can be much more severe, even life-threatening. Those at risk include: . Anyone in a risk group is likely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia. The flu vaccine is given free of charge to: . The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November. For those not deemed at risk, it is possible to pay to have a flu jab. Boots Pharmacies are offering the vaccination in store. Deepa Songara, Boots flu pharmacist said: 'We spend less time outside and much longer closer together at home or in indoor places. 'This 'togetherness' makes it easier to pass germs from one person to another so it is important to think ahead and try to protect yourself before the cold and flu season really kicks in. 'Busy communal places are ideal breeding environments for winter bugs and simple things like washing your hands or using alcohol based hand gel can help keep you well.'",

Lucia Staykov has always been a fitness enthusiast and that didn't change when she fell pregnant to Jordy who is now 12. When she found out she was going to have twins, she kept up her exercise routine up until she was 38 weeks pregnant, modifying her movements to keep her babies safe. And when she was told she would have three baby girls in 2010 she was overjoyed but never did it cross her mind to kick back and stop her from instructing her beloved bootcamp or dance classes. Lucia Staykov with son Jordy 12 (blue grey stripes), twins Alek (white top stripes) and Bailey (black top), triplets Lilly (dark top), Chloe (pink) and Mia (blue) 2 1/2 years stay fit and healthy together .

'Exercise and fitness has always been a part of my life, I can't imagine giving it up and it didn't occur to me when I was pregnant with any of my kids,' Ms Staykov told Daily Mail Australia. The bootcamp instructor and owner of XDrill Challenge, an outdoor bootcamp for groups said that the fact that the classes usually ran in the mornings made it easy for her to keep teaching after she had her kids due to the fact her husband could watch the babies while she taught. Ms Staykov maintained healthy pregnancies for all six of her children and even taught a bootcamp class the morning before her son Jordy was born.

'I feel like the weight dropped when the babies were out, but it took me 12 months of healthy eating and exercise to get back to where I was at and 18 months to where I felt completely happy with my body.' Ms Staykov recommends easing back into exercise once you've been given clearance from your doctor, she kick started her exercise at six weeks after giving birth by going on light walks with her babies. 'Gradually incorporate some walking and abdominal exercises, don't push yourself too hard too early, but slowly build up your strength.' And her abs? 'I'm sure they were under the babies still!' she laughed, ' Because I had that core strength before being pregnant I was able to regain them.' Fitness fanatic Lucia Staykov, 40, and her triplets.

British scientists have been able to fully restore an organ in a living animal for the first time - a breakthrough which may pave the way for the technique to be used in humans. The Scottish team have successfully rebuilt the thymus of 'very old' mice by reactivating a natural mechanism that gets shut down with age. The thymus is an organ central to the immune system, found in front of the heart. The regenerated thymus was not only similar in structure and genetic detail to one in a young mouse, the scientists said, but was also able to function again. After the regeneration, the treated mice also started to make more T-cells - a type of white blood cell key to fighting infections. The regenerated thymus was also more than twice the size of the aged organs in the untreated mice. \u2018By targeting a single protein, we have been able to almost completely reverse age-related shrinking of the thymus,\u2019 said Clare Blackburn from Edinburgh's Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Regenerative Medicine, who led the research. \u2018Our results suggest that targeting the same pathway in humans may improve thymus function and therefore boost immunity in elderly patients, or those with a suppressed immune system.\u2019 She added however, that while the treated mice were making T-cells, her research could not yet establish whether the immune systems of the older mice were strengthened. And before the technique can be tested in humans, she said, researchers will need to conduct more animal experiments to make sure the regeneration process can be tightly controlled. The thymus is the first organ to . deteriorate as people age. This shrinking is one of the main reasons the . immune system becomes less effective and we lose the ability to fight . off new infections, such as flu, as we get older. Regenerative medicine is a fast-growing . area of research, mainly focused on stem cells - the master cells that . act as a source for all types of cells and tissues in the body. One of . the central aims is to harness the body's own repair mechanisms and . manipulate them in a controlled way to treat disease. After the regeneration of the thymus, the mice also started to produce more T-cells (pictured) - a type of white blood cell key to fighting infections . Blackburn's team, whose work was published on Tuesday in the journal Development, said they targeted a part of the process by which the thymus degenerates - a protein called FOXN1 that helps control how key genes in the thymus are switched on. They used genetically modified mice to enable them to increase levels of this protein using chemical signals. By doing so, they managed to instruct immature cells in the thymus - similar to stem cells - to rebuild the organ in the older mice. Rob Buckle, the MRC's head of regenerative medicine, said this success with the mouse thymus suggests organ regeneration in mammals can be directed by manipulating a single protein - something he said could have broad implications for other areas of regenerative biology.",

And with a host of celebrities giving birth in their forties, researchers from Birkbeck University of London and University College London have highlighted a growing trend in their study on older mothers. Singer Gwen Stefani, 44, gave birth to a baby boy called Apollo Bowie Flynn Rossdale in February this year, while actress Halle Berry, 47, gave birth to her latest child Maceo last year. Researchers from from Birkbeck University of London and University College London assessed children of women older than 40, like singer Gwen Stefani who had her third child at 43, and compared them with those born to younger mothers in their twenties . Uma Thurman meanwhile didn't plan on having any more children after the two children she had with ex-husband Ethan Hawke, until she met new man Arpas Busson. They welcomed their daughter Luna into the world when the actress was 42. Researchers assessed children of women older than 40 and compared them with those born to younger mothers in their twenties. While they might tire their mothers out and be harder to catch \u2013 the research suggests children born to mothers over 40 are healthier. The study revealed mothers who give birth over the age of 40 were less likely to have sickly children. Halle Berry, 47, gave birth to her latest child Maceo last year . The study concluded that children of older mothers were 22 percent less likely to accidentally injure themselves and nearly a third less likely to be admitted to hospital by the age of three. The offspring of older women are also more likely to have better emotional well-being as the likelihood of conflict between parent and child was found to decrease as the maternal age increased. And language development by the ages of three and four was also better for the children of older mothers. The number of women over the age of 40 having a baby has increased more than fourfold in the last 30 years, figures from the Office of National Statistics show. In 1982 there were 6,519 live births in England and Wales to women aged 40 or more, about 1 percent of all babies born that year. By 2012 the figure had risen to 29,994, or 4.1% of all live births. Actress Uma Thurman welcomed baby Luna into the world when she was 42. The average age of mothers in England Wales has reached an all time high of 30 . And the average age of mothers having babies has now reached 30 \u2013 the highest ever recorded. Professor Jacqueline Barnes, one of the study leaders, of Birkbeck, said the project was based on the fact that the maternal age was rising. She said: \u2018It has demonstrated that, while there are many medical reasons why close attention should be given to the physical well-being of older mothers and their infants both during pregnancy and immediately after birth, an increase in older motherhood should not necessarily be a cause for concern in relation to subsequent parenting. \u2018Indeed, it is likely that older mothers will be preparing their children well for preschool and then school experiences in a warm and responsive home environment. \u2018The findings of fewer unintentional injuries and fewer socio-emotional problems with increasing maternal age may suggest that women with more life experiences are able to draw upon a wider range of support that can help to reduce some of the stress of parenting.\u2019",

Darren Wilson - the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, who shot the teenager - has told investigators he feared for his life when he opened fire. He claims he was trying to get out of his police car when Brown pushed him back into the driver's seat and reached for his gun through the open window. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: This is the first picture of Darren Wilson standing over Michael Brown after shooting him dead . Claims: Wilson, pictured again surveying the body, insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle . The teenager punched and scratched him repeatedly, he claims, leaving him with swelling on his face and cuts on his neck. Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform. However the account leaked to the New York Times\u00a0last night stops there, and does not explain why Brown was then shot four times outside the car. A number of witnesses agree that Brown and Wilson were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window, but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening. They insist, however, the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands. One passer-by, Tiffany Mitchell, is certain Brown was leaning away but Wilson kept pulling him closer. Another, Dorian Johnson, said Wilson grasped Brown's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot. They then heard shots fired from inside the SUV. There remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired. According to Wilson's description of the August 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today\u00a0- Brown made him fear for his life. 'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown . Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger. Investigators are now examining the officer's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes\u00a0including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter. City officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge Wilson with violating civil rights. In September, Officer Wilson appeared  before a St Louis County grand jury, which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime. His willingness to testify surprised many. However, his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of January 7. Nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against Wilson in order for charges to be leveled. They are expected to vote by mid-November. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against Wilson. He could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial. However, McCulloch chose to take the full investigation of Wilson\u2019s use of deadly force to the grand jury, leaving the 12 members to decide. According to the New York Times, the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the Ferguson Police Department or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry. People claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened. Some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running. The police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun. One witness, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times by Officer Wilson in the middle of a Ferguson, Missouri, street. His death prompted outrage in the community and resulted in several investigations . He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.' Protests in Missouri have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town. Civil rights groups say Brown's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers, an allegation police deny. Officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against Officer Wilson. To press charges, the Justice Department would have to prove that he wilfully violated Brown's rights when he shot him.",

Legal secretary Dawn Smith drew up the bogus document in her office two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey. In her phony document, she made her and her son sole beneficiaries of the fortune - leaving her late husband's two daughters distraught and confused as to why they had been cut out. Jailed: Pregnant widow Dawn Smith was sentenced to 21 months behind bars for faking her husband's will to cut his daughters out of his \u00a31million estate . She has since married again - to a waiter in the Turkish resort of Marmaris - and is now working as a bailiff for a debt company. Smith has left debts against her late husband's name by not settling the \u00a33,600 bill for his funeral, police revealed. She also sold family heirlooms destined for Mr Smith's daughters to fund her trips to Turkey. It emerged she has visited Turkey almost once a month between the death of Mr Smith and her first court appearance in February. At Teeside Crown Court, Judge John Walford told Smith, of Carmel Road North, Darlington, a suspended sentence was not suitable. He said: 'If I had only you and your unborn child to consider, I might have been able to consider that option, but in my judgement to do anything other than pass an immediate custodial sentence would be an affront to your step-daughters who you so cruelly deceived by your actions.' Smith admitted drawing up the false will before his death, forging his signature and those of witnesses. She falsely swore an oath that the document was legal. Judge Walford sentenced her to 21 months, saying: 'I am conscious this will be your first custodial sentence and I cannot ignore the fact that you are pregnant but there will be a sentence of some length to mark the seriousness of this offending.' Forgery: Dawn Smith, left, drew up the bogus document two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey (right) in 2012. She claimed that he wanted her and her son to be given his \u00a31million fortune . Earlier in the sentencing exercise, he questioned the timing of her falling pregnant. It was understood she was 18 weeks pregnant, dating back to her last visit to Turkey, a source said. The judge said: 'There must be a suspicion, to put it no higher, that she has deliberately become pregnant in order to gain an advantage in the sentencing process.' Caroline Goodwin, defending, told him: 'It came as a complete and utter shock to her.' She also read out her client's statement of apology telling the court: 'I can never undo the wrong and how do I say I am sorry when words alone are not enough?' It is understood that her unborn baby is fathered by her new husband, a Turkish waiter, who was not present in court. Miss Goodwin said the pregnancy was also a surprise to her partner. The court heard how Mr Smith's family found it very hard to accept that his widow had remarried so soon after his death. Describing the full ordeal,\u00a0Mr Smith's daughter Karen Harwood, 43, said: 'I've not even grieved for his death yet as this has been so upsetting. 'It is hard not knowing what my dad's final wishes were. She took that away.' In a victim impact statement read out in open court, she added: 'After dad died, I welcomed Dawn Smith into our family and took her to see my daughter Alice in a play, four days before she was arrested. Cut out: The daughters of Harvey Smith, Karen Harwood (left) and Zoe Traherne, read a statement outside court today speaking about their horrendous ordeal . 'Because of her actions, it made me think, what have I done to make Dad think this of me? 'It made me think why my dad would turn his back on his daughter and his grandchildren for a woman he had known less than a quarter of my life.' Miss Harwood also spoke of how the family had spent \u00a320,000 in court costs trying to contest the will and to clear Mr Smith's name of debt. Astonishingly, as Mr Smith's spouse, she is still entitled to his \u00a3490,000 pension, despite her deceit. Her father Harvey Smith, who owned an engineering firm, was given an MBE for services to industry in 1986. Smith faked the signatures of her husband, another legal secretary and a solicitor on the bogus document she drew up in 2010. After his death in November 2012, she told his family she didn't believe he had a last will and testament. But she later produced the paperwork - back-dated to February 2011 - which left their \u00a3500,000 house in Darlington and \u00a3420,000 pension to her. It excluded Karen and included explicit instructions that her sister Zoe, 25, should not receive anything at all. Her deception was uncovered when a partner at the Darlington law firm of Hewitts, where Smith had worked, thought it suspicious the women were overlooked while Dawn Smith's son was included. Moving on:\u00a0Smith has since remarried to a Turkish waiter, pictured together, who works in the resort of Marmaris. She sold her late husband's family heirlooms in order to pay for trips to Turkey after his death . The lawyer - a personal friend of Mr Smith - raised concerns and staff spotted basic errors. One of the supposed witnesses had left the firm at the time they were said to have signed it, and the other had changed offices.

Hobbyist Wayne Skinner and his family are facing an extra \u00a3500 on their bills this year - but say it's all worth it to raise money for the local air ambulance. Dozens of neighbours gathered in Bolsover, Derbyshire, for the big switch-on at the two-bed semi-detached home where the 26-year-old lives with his parents John and Susan. Scroll down for video . Deck the halls! Hobbyist Wayne Skinner and his family are facing an extra \u00a3500 on the bills for their semi-detached home in Bolsover, Derbyshire - but say it's all worth it to raise money for the local air ambulance . The dazzling display includes glowing Santa figures, doves with flapping wings, and bells which sound as if they're ringing thanks to a synchronised soundtrack. Mr Skinner, who trained as an electrician and works in the electrical department at Wickes, said: 'The lights are sequenced in time with the music with special software and it's all controlled via two control panels. 'We don't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we've got the lights on because it's an old house and an old supply, and we don't like putting too much power on it. 'So we boil the kettle, pour it in a flask and have a flask of hot water while the lights are on.' The display, in its 12th year, takes seven weeks to assemble and costs a fortune - including \u00a3150 for a control panel, \u00a3150 for software and another \u00a3600 for a control board shipped in from the U.S. Electrician: Mr Skinner, 26, making the finishing touches to his glowing teddies. He has spent thousands on the displays, including \u00a3600 for a control board which had to be ordered from across the Atlantic . Mr Skinner said: 'We don't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we've got the lights on because it's an old house and we don't like putting too much power on it.\u00a0So we boil the kettle and pour it in a flask' In many previous years it cost more than it raised, making an average of around \u00a3300 a year. But last year the donations rocketed to around \u00a3850, and Mr Skinner said he had high hopes for this year's event. 'We get more and more visitors as the word gets round and it's becoming more popular,' he said. Mr Skinner's mother helped switch on the lights this week dressed as Santa in a sleigh pulled by two shire horses. It took six and a half hours to program just one song, DIsney's Frozen, to play in time with the lights. Even if it's raining onlookers can still watch the display from their car, as it's being broadcast on FM radio. Ordinary home - extraordinary lights: The family house even broadcasts the soundtrack on FM radio . Then and now: Mr Skinner (right) was inspired as a toddler by the Blackpool Illuminations (left) There is also a pixel matrix screen which Mr Skinner built, a 'reindeer-cam' which beams the scene into the Skinners' front room and seven other cameras. Mr Skinner was a toddler when he became obsessed with Christmas lights after seeing the Blackpool Illuminations. It sparked a life-long hobby - and some of his display even includes lights once used in the seaside town. 'I've always wanted to get a job working on the Blackpool Illuminations but I think they only employ people who live nearby, so I decided to make my own', he said. 'It's a nice thing to put a hobby into making people smile, making people happy and raising money for charity at the same time. 'It's a win-win, everyone benefits really'.",

Harry Potter author JK Rowling is set to release her second crime novel under the pen name of Robert Galbraith. The book, called Silkworm, will be released on June 19th, according to publishers, and will be a sequel of the number one bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling. Her latest work will again feature private detective Cormoran Strike, a war veteran who is hired to investigate a supermodel's supposed suicide. Crime novel: The book will be the second the 48-year-old author has written under the name Robert Galbraith . It will see Strike and his assistant, Robin Ellacott, unravelling the death of writer Owen Quine after they are asked to investigate his disappearance. The pair then uncover a damning manuscript with the details of a number of Quine's associates, who are described in a negative way. The publisher describes it as 'a compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn'. Popular: The Cuckoo's Calling became an international best seller last year after the author's true identity was revealed . The new description reads: 'At first, Mrs Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days \u2013 as he has done before \u2013 and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home. 'But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realises. 'The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. 'If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives \u2013 meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced. 'When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer.' The 48-year-old had aimed to keep her crime writing venture a secret, but the pseudonym was made public by a solicitor. The lawyer has since been fined and the author was paid damages, which she gave to charity. At the time, she said: 'I had hoped to keep this secret a little longer. It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name.' It is Rowling's third novel for adults, the first being Casual Vacancy, which was released in 2012. Case: Rowling received damages after her secret was unraveled, and she donated the final amount to charity . Cover: The novel will be released on June 19 and publishers have said the story has 'twists at every turn'",

    "input": "(CNN) -- World rugby champions South Africa held off spirited second-half fightback from New Zealand to win 32-29 and clinch their first Tri-Nations crown in five years on Saturday. Jean De Villiers, Victor Matfield and Bismarck Du Plessis celebrate winning the Tri-Nations with their supporters. The Springboks had to overcome an early setback at the Waikato Stadium in Hamilton as Dan Carter kicked the All Blacks in front after South Africa were penalized in gathering the kick-off. But Francois Steyn stepped up to plate for South Africa and he kicked over penalties from 60 and 58 meters to give the Springboks an advantage they would retain for the remainder of the game. South Africa stretched their lead when winger Bryan Habana barged opposite number Joe Rokocoko out of the way going for a high ball, and Fourie du Preez was on hand to run over the try. Morne Steyn, who took the closer kicks, landed the conversion and Peter de Villiers' side were firmly in command at 16-6. Additional penalties from Carter and both Steyns completed the first-half scoring with the All Blacks guilty of missing at least two try-scoring chances when star flyhalf Carter and then center Stephen Donald surrendered possession attempting to kick through the posts. Indeed it was Carter who made a crucial error as South Africa raced into a 29-12 lead when his attempted pass to Isaia Toeava was collected by Jean de Villiers, who sprinted away to score unopposed and Morne Steyn was able to convert. The All Blacks rallied as winger Sitiveni Sivivatu ran over for their first try and Carter successfully kicked the conversion and a penalty to cut the margin to seven points, but Morne Steyn kept the Springboks ahead with a second penalty. Captain Richie McCaw was able to touch down for New Zealand in the dying stages but the scoreline flattered the All Blacks, who were largely outplayed in the match. The win gave the Springboks their third Tri-Nations title and also saw them record three consecutive Test victories over the defending champions for the first time since 1976. It also meant that the final match of the tournament between bottom side Australia and their trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand next weekend in Wellington will be largely played for pride.",

    "input": "MATURA, Trinidad (CNN) -- With its white sand and clear, blue water, Trinidad's Matura Beach looks like a postcard. It's a far cry from its recent past, when leatherback sea turtle carcasses littered the ground and kept tourists away. Suzan Lakhan Baptiste's efforts have turned a beach from a leatherback turtle graveyard to a nesting colony. \"Twenty years ago, this was a graveyard,\" Suzan Lakhan Baptiste said of the six-mile stretch of beach near her home. \"The stench was horrendous. You could smell it for miles,\" she said. Saddened and frustrated, Baptiste launched a crusade to help end the slaughter of the gentle giants. Today, she and her group are succeeding: What was once a turtle graveyard is now a maternity ward -- one of the largest leatherback nesting colonies in the world. It hasn't been an easy fight for Baptiste or the turtles. For 100 million years, the creatures have traveled the world's oceans, outliving the dinosaurs. Over the last 30 years, they have become critically endangered worldwide because of fishing, pollution and hunting. For centuries, they've been hunted throughout the Caribbean for their meat and fins, and also for their eggs, which some people prize as aphrodisiacs. \"Turtles are in serious trouble,\" Baptiste said. Every year, female leatherbacks make their way onto the beach, laying their eggs deep in the sand. It is a long, complicated ritual during which the enormous, slow-moving animals are easy prey for poachers. \"Leatherbacks [are] very vulnerable,\" Baptiste said. \"They cannot pull their head and flippers back into the shell. They have no sense of defense to actually protect themselves.\" By the 1980s, nearly one in three turtles that nested on Matura Beach were killed. When the government asked for volunteers to help protect the endangered creatures, Baptiste and several others answered the call. In 1990, they started Nature Seekers, one of Trinidad's first environmental groups. 'Crazy Turtle Woman' For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season. She often walked alone until sunrise. Locals mocked her efforts, calling her the \"Turtle Police\" or \"Crazy Turtle Woman,\" yet her dedication to the unpaid work was fierce; when it conflicted with her day job, she quit and found a new job. Leatherbacks were a vital source of income for some members of her village, and the poachers who prowled the beaches with machetes could be threatening. When Baptiste's then-husband was injured during a patrol, she became more determined to stand her ground. \"I was very vigilant,\" she said, adding that at times, she even got into physical fights. But Baptiste persisted, and a prestigious award from the United Nations Environment Program helped validate her efforts. She and her group also worked hard to convince the villagers that using the turtles for eco-tourism could create a more sustainable income. \"I wanted to show that a turtle is [worth] so much more to us alive than dead,\" Baptiste said. Gradually, her message of conservation turned the tide of public opinion, and after nearly two decades under Baptiste's leadership, Nature Seekers has largely won its battle. Today, the leatherbacks' survival rate on Matura Beach is virtually 100 percent. \"Here, turtle slaughter is a thing of the past,\" Baptiste proclaimed. Even \"Papa George,\" a village elder who used to hunt leatherbacks with his father, can attest to the cultural shift. \"Suzan brought around the change,\" he said. \"They don't kill the turtles anymore ... because of the visitors.\" Nearly 10,000 tourists a year, most of whom are Trinidadian, now visit Matura Beach, and many locals make a living by providing them with accommodations, food and souvenirs. Since the beach is a prohibited area during the nesting season, Nature Seekers' members act as guides, explaining the turtles' ancient rituals to visitors. In addition, Baptiste and her colleagues gather data on the enormous creatures, tagging and weighing as many leatherbacks as they can.  Watch Baptiste and her group weigh a leatherback turtle at night \u00bb . During peak season, they might see between 250 or 300 turtles a night. More than 5,000 leatherbacks nest in the area each year. The group's work is often cited as one of the most successful eco-tourism efforts in the Caribbean. Still, turtle slaughter persists throughout the region, and Baptiste is working to help other groups learn from her success, most recently on the island of Dominica. She finds joy in sharing her hard-earned knowledge. \"The passion that I feel, it burns me up,\" she said. \"I have seen the fruits of our labor, and it can happen in every community.\"  Watch how Baptiste helped end the slaughter of turtles in her community \u00bb . Her efforts -- and those of many others around the region -- are making a difference. While leatherbacks are still critically endangered worldwide, the Caribbean population has begun to rebound. \"When I got started, a lot of people thought I was crazy,\" Baptiste said, and she admits that she sometimes wondered if they were right. Reflecting on what she and her team have accomplished, she now believes it was worth it. \"I love being crazy, you know?\" she said, laughing. \"Crazy with a passion, crazy with a dream -- totally environmentally crazy.\" Want to get involved?

More tests are being done, amid claims from the woman's family that she was gang-raped and murdered by five men, including her brother-in-law. The alleged attack comes just weeks after the bodies of two cousins, aged 14 and 15, were founding hanging from a mango tree in the Budaun district of the same state. Of the five suspects arrested, police say three have confessed to the rape, but not murder. Woman found in tree . In the latest case, the 42-year-old woman was found hanging from a tree in the Bahraich district. Her family told police she went missing around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night, and her body was found Wednesday morning, Bahraich district police chief, Happy Guptan, said. \"We are not commenting how it all happened until our investigation is complete,\" Guptan told CNN. Calls for strong political action to change attitudes and stop rape in India have grown louder since December 2012, when a student was gang-raped and murdered by attackers on a moving bus. The 23-year-old's horrific injuries made headlines and started a national debate about how many rapes were happening and why. Call to stop 'politicizing rape' In his first address to parliament as Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi addressed the issue on Wednesday, warning lawmakers against \"politicizing rape.\" \"I appeal to our political leaders that we should not carry out psychological analysis of rape ... Is it correct to make a statement always? Why can't we just keep quiet. Respect and security for women should be the topmost priority of the entire people,\" he said. His comments came after observers seized on statements made by Babulal Gaur, the home minister of Madhya Pradesh, that rape was a \"social crime\" -- \"sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.\" Other politicians were also accused of trivializing the crime with comments including an observation that rapes \"happen accidentally,\" while another suggested \"boys make mistakes.\" In a veiled reference to those comments last week, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: \"We say no to the dismissive, destructive attitude of 'boys will be boys'. Together, we can empower more people to understand that violence against women degrades us all.\" Ban made the comments while launching a video campaign on ending sexual violence through gender equality.

It almost wasn't a very Merry Christmas for Tim McKeague, 29, when just three days earlier a female driver passed out and struck him at an uncontrollable speed on West Coast Drive in Perth. It's hard to believe from the shocking footage that Mr McKeague\u00a0lived to tell the story - let alone walk away without any injuries from the frightening accident where the woman collected a total of three parked cars. Even more miraculously - the unconscious woman and the little girl, who was in the backseat, also survived the crash without any injuries. Scroll down for video . The out-of-control-car first hits the white ute on the side of the road on West Coast Drive in Perth . The car then collides with Tim McKeague who was standing beside the next parked car . The car eventually comes to a standstill after smashing into a third parked car while Mr McKeague\u00a0can be seen rolling around in pain on the side of the road . Mr\u00a0McKeague said he could see the driver was unconscious as the car was veering towards him. 'I just let go and let my body relax and the car just went straight through me,' he told Channel Nine News. Immediately after the crash, Mr McKeague couldn't move his right leg and paramedics thought it was broken. 'I started feeling more and more lucky as the minutes went past and as I got more feeling,' he said. 'It just kept getting more moveable and it was amazing - by the time I got to the hospital I was moving.' Two days later, the keen and extremely lucky surfer was back out in the water doing what he loves. Mark Doyle, and his son Jake, were taking a leisurely coastal drive when the vehicle in front of them unexpectedly smashed into the parked cars along the beachfront which was captured on their Dash Cam on Monday. Mr McKeague, 29, could not believe that he survived as he watched the footage of the Dash Cam . First thought to have broken his right leg,\u00a0Mr McKeague went surfing tow days later . Jake (pictured) and Mark (right) were the first to rush to the aid of Mr McKeague who survived uninjured . More witnesses arrive and a woman walks around to check on the unconscious driver who also survived with no injuries along with the little girl in the backseat . Mark can be heard merrily whistling to a song by The Doors on the radio as they are driving along just seconds before the woman hit a parked vehicle, then struck the man who was standing by the next parked car before colliding with a third which forced her to come to a complete stop. The injured man can be seen rolling around in pain while holding his leg on the side of the road as Jake and Mark run to his aid and several other witnesses rush over to the scene. Mark posted the footage on Facebook on New Years Day with the comment : 'Ok people, new year, let's be careful out there. You never know who is on the roads.' The alarming video has been seen by more than 275,000 people and shared almost 3,500 times. Mark said in this post that the female driver told him that she had blacked out at the time. Mark and Jake were praised for rushing to the aid of the man with some social media users describing them as heroes. 'Thankfully it was only his leg and foot.. Well done you two for assisting...

Meanwhile, the woman who released the latest slew of explicit sex messages and naked pictures has said that she was truly in love with the disgraced former Congressman during their six-month virtual affair. Sydney Leathers, now 23, spoke out for the first time since her identity was revealed that she believed the feelings to be mutual, but now she is 'disgusted by him'. A preview of her interview with Inside Edition was released shortly after Weiner held a press conference on Thursday afternoon where he disclosed an approximate break down of his sexting timeline, just hours after the latest poll revealed he has lost his front-runner lead in the New York City mayoral race. New York Magazine reports . that at a press conference on Thursday, Weiner said 'it's six to ten . (women) I suppose' as the total number of women he has had virtual . relationships with in his lifetime. Scroll down for video . Coming clean: Anthony Weiner, seen here at a food center on Thursday, said that he sexted with a total of 'six to ten' women, both before and after his resignation from Congress . Dirty details: Women that he had virtual relationships with included Lisa Weiss (left) before his resignation, and Sydney Leathers (right) after . When . asked to clarify how many of those relationships started after he . resigned from Congress in June 2011, he said: 'I don't believe more than . three'. Today has not been good in terms of any . numbers for Weiner, as the first poll since the Leathers revelation . shows that he has been bumped out of the lead in the mayoral race. In love: Sydney Leathers said that she was in love with Weiner, and that he told her that he loved her as well . During the Inside Edition interview, Leathers told how she was initially attracted to Weiner because of his politics but now she has seen another side of him. 'He's not who I thought he was,' she said. She said that both she and Weiner said that they loved each other during their virtual romance, and Indiana-based Leathers has previously said that he offered to secure a condo for her in Chicago so that they could meet for trysts beyond the computer screen. When asked what she would like to say to him now, she responded: 'Stop lying, stop embarrassing his wife, and get help.' The renewed discussion about his sexual indiscretions was prompted by Leather's decision to release screen grabs of their conversations to gossip site The Dirty as well as pictures of his genitals, all of which were exchanged more than one year after he resigned from Congress. His drop in the polls comes as Weiner confirmed he had virtual relationships with three women after his 2011 resignation from Congress and between six and ten similar situations prior to leaving office. The first poll conducted after his relationship with then-22-year-old Sydney Leather was revealed just came out Thursday afternoon and has City Council Speaker Christine Quinn leading with 25 per cent of the Democratic vote. Weiner comes in second place with only 16 per cent- down from his earlier 26 per cent lead from a different poll that measured the public's thinking the week preceding the Tuesday revelations. 'These new revelations have cost Anthony Weiner the lead in the Democratic field,' director of Marist College polling Lee Miringoff told The Wall Street Journal, which co-sponsored the poll. Carrying on: Anthony Weiner, seen here campaigning on Thursday, asserts that he will continue with his bid to become New York City's next mayor in spite of the latest scandal and his plummeting poll numbers . Competitors: The latest poll, conducted post scandal, says that Weiner is in second place and followed by the city's former comptroller Bill Thompson . In addition to taking away his lead, . the release of naked photos and explicit sex chats have driven up his . unfavorability rating, bringing him up to an 'all-time high' of 55 per . cent. By comparison, his unfavorables were only at 36 per cent in June. This . latest survey took place entirely on Wednesday, the day after the . former Obama campaign worker shared her illicit sex chats and photos of . Weiner's genitals with gossip site The Dirty. New frontrunner: City Council speaker Christine Quinn (seen with Weiner behind her at a sleep out on Wednesday night to highlight housing issues in the city) leads with 25 per cent of the Democratic vote . Later . that same day, the disgraced congressman and his wife Huma Abedin held a . joint press conference declaring their dedication to both one another . and the campaign. The Wall Street Journal/Marist poll suggests that there is a good number of New Yorkers who agree with that decision. Of . the 1,199 people surveyed, 47 per cent of registered Democrats said he . should stay in the race- which is the same number who believe he . deserves a second chance. That . percentage of the electorate is just slightly bigger than the 43 per . cent who said he should drop out. And 45 per cent of New York Democrats . believe he does not have the character to be mayor of the country's . largest city. Prior to this afternoon's poll, things were still looking positive for Weiner. The latest poll Quinnipiac University poll reveals that . during the week leading up to the Sydney Leather scandal, Weiner came . out on top with 26 per cent of the Democratic vote, with City Council . Speaker Christine Quinn following with 22 per cent and former . comptroller Bill Thompson with 20 per cent. The . poll may not carry the same weight now, however, as it weighed the . opinions of voters between July 18 and July 23, and Weiner's messages to . Sydney Leather were only made public on the 23rd. Weiner sent an email to supporters on Wednesday, just hours after he and his wife Huma Abedin gave a joint press conference about the messages and photos, where he said that the bid for New York City's mayor was 'too important' to give up over 'embarrassing personal things'. Problems: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner said he resorted to sexting strangers during a 'rough patch' in his marriage with wife Huma Abedin (right) Moving past it: Sydney Leathers (right) is believed to be the woman who sexted with Anthony Weiner (pictured on the campaign trail in New York City) Trying to move the cycle: Weiner maintained that he will continue with his bid to become New York's next mayor . Rivals, newspaper editorial pages and . former New York congressional colleagues urged the Democrat to quit . after he acknowledged exchanging raunchy messages and photos online . after he had resigned from Congress for similar behaviour. Jerrold Nadler, Democratic . representative for New York's 10th congressional district, said: 'I . think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious . psychiatric help.' Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, who was also Weiner's colleague back when he was a Democratic representative for the city, said his antics were a 'total distraction' from the real issues the mayoral campaign should be debating. The latest scandal erupted on Tuesday . after the gossip website The Dirty posted X-rated messages and a crotch . shot it said Weiner exchanged with a woman last year while using the . online alias 'Carlos Danger'. The New York Times cited his 'marital troubles and personal compulsions' as reasons for the 48-year-old Democrat to leave the race while The Wall Street Journal claimed he should be forced out 'simply because of what he's forced his wife to endure'. 'I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him': Huma Abedin read a statement at the Tuesday press conference reaffirming her belief in her husband and their marriage . Standing united: Anthony Weiner had his wife Huma Abedin at his side when he addressed the new revelations of another sexually inappropriate relationship that took place a year after he resigned . 'The serially evasive Mr. Weiner . should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the . public eye and the mayoral race,' the Times wrote. The Daily News declared Weiner to be . 'lacking the dignity and discipline that New York deserves in a mayor,\" and said \"his demons have no place in City Hall.' At least three of his mayoral rivals, . Bill de Blasio and Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire . businessman John Catsimatidis, a Republican, said he should drop out. 'Anthony's presence in this race has . become a never-ending sideshow that is distracting us from the debate of . the serious issues of this election,' de Blasio said.

Violent: Former charity worker Scott Western (pictured) faces jail for beating his wife after becoming her 'slave master' in a bizarre sex pact . A charity director inflicted a string of violent beatings on his wife after becoming her 'slave master' in a sadomasochistic pact. Scott Western, 44, lashed Therese Western with a belt when she 'broke the rules' of their bizarre sex agreement, which they had entered into in a bid to save their 15-year marriage. He faces jail after he admitted threatening her with violence, inducing her to remove her clothes, slapping her on the face, striking her on the body with a belt, seizing her by the hair and slapping her. Western pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last week to a charge of assaulting Mrs Western, 46, on June 10 last year. Mrs Western went to police after suffering three beatings on the same day at their Wester Hailes flat near Edinburgh, leaving her needing hospital treatment. A court heard both Western and his wife had signed a copy of a contract, which contained rules for the couple\u2019s master and slave relationship, specifying sexual acts and household chores which had to be completed by Mrs Western. She faced 'punishment' if she failed to comply. Among the 'rules' that she broke and received a beating for were failing to answer a question quickly enough, opening the passenger door of their car instead of waiting for him to do it and refusing to have sex when he wanted. Western has resigned from his position at the Wester Hailes-based Community Help and Advice Initiative, which he has been involved with since 1997. CHAI project manager David Gardner said: 'He had admitted to us he was the subject of criminal proceedings of a domestic nature. He resigned at the same time that he was pleading guilty to the offences.' 'Unusual relationship': Western pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court (above) to a charge of assaulting Mrs Western, 46, on June 10 last year . Charity staff were unaware of the precise nature of the allegations against Western. He left his position as director last year once the criminal investigation began, although he returned when he believed the case against him would be dropped and was re-elected at an AGM in September. Mr Gardner said Western had not come into contact with service users. 'It was a voluntary and hands-off role. Directors meet once a month and review reports and oversee the financial side of things. 'I had a conversation with him and he said he had been given legal advice to plead guilty. 'I think he realised he should stand down. He contributed as all directors do. Whatever happened in his personal life is a personal tragedy. It had nothing to do with his work.' Western, a community worker, has no previous convictions. In mitigation, it was said the couple had an 'unusual relationship' which could be 'categorised as alternative'. CHAI, a social welfare charity to relieve poverty, has received funding from the city council, NHS Lothian and Edinburgh Drug and Alcohol Partnership. A council spokesperson said: 'This is a matter for CHAI.' Western, who now lives in Murrayburn Grove, Edinburgh, will be sentenced next month.",

Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this medical examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined.\" Read more: 'Accidental' removed from Natalie Wood's death certificate . Based on a number of factors, including the lack of a life jacket, lack of a suicide note, \"this Medical Examiner is unable to exclude non-volitional, unplanned entry into the water,\" the report says. \"How injury occurred will be listed as found floating in the ocean,\" it adds. \"Circumstances not clearly established.\" The change in the cause of death was made public last year, but the report outlining the reasons -- which was dated June 15, 2012 -- was not made public until Monday. The case is \"open and ongoing; nothing definitive has closed it,\" said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. He said that Wood's widower, actor Robert Wagner, is not a suspect. A security hold was placed on the report when it came out because of concern \"that the frenzy that's surrounding this could contaminate the investigation,\" Whitmore said. The hold was lifted last week and the report made public Monday after next of kin were notified. Homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries in November 2011 after they were contacted by people who said they had additional information about the actress's death, the sheriff's department said last summer. The announcement persuaded tipsters to come forward with additional \"intriguing\" information, sheriff's spokesman Whitmore told CNN last January. Investigators did not comment directly on statements made in news reports in November by Dennis Davern, the captain of a yacht owned by Wood and her husband. Davern offered a previously unreported account of how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island following an argument between the couple. Wood died on November 29, 1981, off the isthmus of Catalina Island. Dressed in a flannel nightgown, socks and a down jacket, her body was found floating about a mile from the yacht, according to police reports. The autopsy report showed the 43-year-old actress had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek and bruises on her arms. \"My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,\" said Lana Wood, referring to theories that the actress may have voluntarily jumped from the boat, last year. Although the county coroner's office ruled at the time that Wood's death was an accident, others said then that that made no sense. Read more: Mysterious celebrity deaths . In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believed an argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN in 2011 that she did not suspect foul play. \"I just want the truth to come out, the real story,\" she said. Davern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour, broke his silence with an account of that day in \"Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,\" a book he co-wrote that was published in 2009. Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner. In an interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he believed the investigation was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regretted misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request. Wood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They invited Wood's \"Brainstorm\" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on the Thanksgiving weekend sail that preceded her death. The Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous of Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple. In his book. \"Pieces of My Heart,\" also published in September 2009, Wagner acknowledged being jealous and having fought with Wood. After Wagner then argued with Walken and broke a wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting. Embarrassed, Davern said, he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. \"They'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing,\" he said. A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing. Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper. Read more: Natalie Wood's star power lasted for decades . Wagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off. Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own, he wrote. He radioed the restaurant on shore where they'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen Wood. The dinghy was found about a mile from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found. Wood's first starring role was as a child in \"Miracle on 34th Street\" in 1947, and she played alongside some of Hollywood's top leading men -- James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and Warren Beatty in \"Splendor in the Grass.\" She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for \"Love with the Proper Stranger\" (1963), according to IMDb. One of her more memorable roles was as Maria in \"West Side Story.\" Wagner landed roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television. He starred in two series, \"It Takes a Thief\" (1968-70) and \"Hart to Hart\" (1979-84), and more recently as Number Two in the \"Austin Powers\" spy spoofs.

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Shamita Naidoo said she often wonders whether anyone really ever sees her. She also wonders the same thing about the hundreds of people living around her, in tiny tin shacks perched underneath gum trees on a nearby hill. Around one million people live near Africa's largest slum, Kibera, located near Nairobi, Kenya. Sometimes, she said, it seems like they all are invisible. The shantytown where Naidoo lives is on the outskirts of Durban, South Africa, in an area known as Motala Heights. The squatter community has been there for a number of years, but it's increasingly being squeezed out by nearby factories and suburban neighborhoods. Some residents, according to Naidoo, have already been evicted. Others are afraid that they could soon be forced to move. And almost everyone fears that if they have to leave, there may be nowhere else to go. \"We are like a lost city,\" said Naidoo, who shares a home with her two children and 10 other families. \"We are not known.\" United Nations Habitat estimates that roughly 1 billion people -- or 33 percent of the world's urban population -- live in conditions like those of Naidoo and her family. By 2030, according to the UN's human settlement program, that number is likely to double. The slum dwellers struggle to survive with little clean water and sometimes no electricity around metropolises like Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Mumbai, India; Lima, Peru; and Istanbul, Turkey. Their shantytowns are usually vast in expanse and dense in population. In Kibera, a slum near Nairobi, Kenya, for example, more than a million people live in an area about the size of New York's Central Park. Yet despite their overpowering nature and unavoidable presence, the world's informal cities are often overlooked -- partly, according to UN Habitat, because many aid efforts are still focused on helping the rural poor: \"Rural poverty has long been the world's most common face of destitution,\" U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a 2006 world city report. \"But urban poverty can be just as intense, dehumanizing and life-threatening.\" The problem can also seem too big. The slums appear impenetrable to outsiders. And no one wants to take full responsibility. So walls are built, blinders are put on, and the shantytowns simply fade into the backdrop of urban life. \"We still don't know what to do,\" said Edesio Fernandes, a professor of urban planning at the University of London. \"A huge amount of money has been spent and very little has been achieved in terms of reversing the phenomenon.\" Although slums, in and of themselves, are nothing new -- some Brazilian favelas are more than 100 years old, Fernandes said, and many modern cities, like New York and London, once had prolific slum-dwelling populations -- what is unprecedented is the rate at which they are growing. The UN estimates that almost 70 million people move into cities each year, many of them poor. Yet this, according to some experts, should not be seen as a problem but rather as a potential way to win the war against global poverty. The mindset must shift from \"city as problem to city as solution,\" said Stewart Brand, president of the Long Now Foundation, which aims to raise awareness on solving long-term problems. Historically, Brand said, squatter cities have always been areas of economic expansion; within them there is virtually no unemployment, and their inhabitants are constantly striving to lift themselves out of destitution, he said. \"[Slums] are generating wealth the way cities have always done,\" Brand said. In India, almost 20 percent of the GDP comes from Mumbai, where half the city's 12 million residents live in slums, Brand said. And even though many slum dwellers work in the informal economy, the official economy benefts as workers accumulate income and can afford to buy more goods and services outside their shadow neighborhoods. Urbanization also leads to lower birth rates, Brand said, which means as more people migrate to cities, the world's population could eventually level off at around 8 billion or 9 billion and then rapidly drop. But to both capture and capitalize upon the potentialities of slums, more must also be done to embrace the people who reside in them and understand how they live their lives, said Robert Neuwirth, a journalist who spent two years living in shantytowns around the world. Many employees working in Rio's high-end hotels and restaurants live in nearby favelas, Neuwirth said. And not all slum dwellers are necessarily poor -- a survey of more than 200 slums across India by Shelter Associates, which provides support to informal settlements, found residents with a variety of jobs, including government employees, small entrepreneurs and even doctors. \"Outsiders tend to view these as repositories of criminality, and they are not at all,\" he said. \"These are hardworking communities whose aspirations are the same as yours and mine, and the sooner we understand that, the sooner we can begin working with these communities.\" Some progress has been made, especially in Latin America, around cities like Rio. There, despite the presence of drug gangs who largely control the communities, a handful of favelas are undergoing a sort of gentrification. Businesses like cable television companies and banks have moved in, and tourists are even making reservations to stay in new shantytown hotels, Neuwirth said. Yet in the Motala Heights slum in South Africa, along with many others around the world, the situation remains stagnant as governments continue to deny slum dwellers basic infrastructure and property rights and occasionally even demolish entire parts of shantytowns altogether, forcing their dwellers to move to another piece of land and try, once again, to build a new life. \"We have to recognize these people as people and not as statistics,\" Neuwirth said. \"The way forward is to engage with them.\" ..................................................................................

    "input": "Old Navy is introducing a new style of jeans coined 'skinny' and 'boyfriend' jeans for their children's line and some mothers across the country are deeming the styles inappropriate. The Gap owned affordable clothing chain touts jeggings, super skinny, skinny, boot-cut, and boyfriend skinny among its new looks. The jean styles for children are 'mini me' versions of the adult style of women's jeans which also include options like the diva, the flirt, and the sweetheart. Too young?: These young girls are modeling the new Old Navy boyfriend jean which is causing concern among some parents and psychologists . Trendy or too much?: Old Navy argues they are merely mirroring their adult styles of jeans in a playful way . 'Why not just call them 'loose fit?\u2019' said Janet Choi, 41, a mother of two from Bushwick to the New York Daily News. Another mother added that the term skinny jean may urge some children to worry about their weight prematurely. ABC reports that a New York City psychologist said that the term 'boyfriend' shouldn't be applied to young children because they may feel the need to grow up too fast. 'Can\u2019t we just buy jeans because we like them, and not have the \u2018boyfriend\u2019 label associated with them?,' said Joe Taravella, PhD and supervisor of pediatric psychology at Rusk Rehabilitation at New York University Langone Medical Center. 'It sets up our children to want and need a boyfriend, when at these early ages, this terminology should not be part of their vocabulary or on the radar of what they should be thinking about,' Taravella told ABC News. 'I am hard-pressed to understand why the label 'boyfriend' was associated with these jeans.' The New York Daily News also spoke with a psychologist who argued that insinuating romantic relationships in children's fashion may cause them to 'grow up too fast.' 'It\u2019s another unfortunate example of how sexualization is getting younger and younger,' says Dr. Jennifer Hartstein, a child psychologist in Manhattan. New styles: Parents are outraged about the new boyfriend jeans for girls deemed too young to have a boyfriend or think about romantic relationships . 'It\u2019s not so much the existence of the boyfriend jean that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s the message that girls will pick up,' Hartstein adds. 'At (age) 2 she may not be so aware, but as she gets older, she will start to internalize these messages,' she says. ABC News spoke with the founder of Big City Moms, a resource center for New York based mothers with over 300,000 members. 'I think it\u2019s just being true to their style names,' Leslie Venokur told ABC News. 'My kids don\u2019t know what the style is called. I give them jeans and if the jeans are comfortable, they wear them.' Venokur who has children aged two and six says that the marketing is aimed at parents buying their children clothing modeled after their own style. 'Do they need to change it? No,' Venokur said . 'If they want to appease some opinionated parents, then that\u2019s their call.' The New York Daily News reports that other comparable children\u2019s designers don\u2019t call looser pan 'boyfriend jeans.' H&M calls theirs 'denim pants' or 'loose-fit jeans.' OshKosh B\u2019gosh and Gymboree don\u2019t even offer the style. Abercrombie does sell boyfriend jeans, but only for older girls. Despite the complaints among some parents the brand does not plan on changing their whole campaign. Perfect or potentially harmful?: While some parents think the style is inappropriate, other moms claim their kids don't pay attention to the advertisements .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A former Pennsylvania juvenile judge was sentenced to 28 years in prison Thursday after being convicted for a scheme to make millions off unjustly incarcerating young people, court officials said. Former Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella was also ordered by a federal judge in Pennsylvania to pay about $1 million in restitution. The sentence was four times the 87 months sentence that Ciavarella and federal prosecutors had agreed to when he pleaded guilty to charges in 2009. But that plea deal was thrown out by a federal judge and the case went to trial. Ciavarella was found guilty in February of 12 of 39 racketeering and fraud charges for accepting millions of dollars in bribes from friends who owned detention centers to which he sent juveniles. The case made national headlines when Ciavarella was confronted by a distraught mother outside a courtroom after his conviction. Sandy Fonzo's 17-year-old son, Edward Kenzakowski, spent six months in a detention center after Ciavarella sentenced him for possession of drug paraphernalia. According to Fonzo, her son, who had no prior record, was never able to recover and eventually took his own life. \"He (Ciavarella) killed his spirit,\" Fonzo said at the time, \"He crushed him, and he didn't help him.\" Fonzo said her son was full of resentment and pent-up anger after being sent to the detention center. \"He was just never the same,\" Fonzo said. She said in February she came to the courthouse believing Ciavarella would be taken straight to jail. But when she found out he was going home and would not be sentenced until later, she was shocked and angered, and began shouting at Ciavarella. Fonzo's confrontation was captured by television cameras. \"Do you remember me?\" Fonzo screamed lunging toward Ciavarella, \"Do you remember my son?\" she screamed again. \"He's gone,\" she cried, \"He shot himself in the heart, you scumbag!\"",

Refugees gather behind barbed wire at one of Sri Lanka's camps for those displaced by recent fighting. The Times said it had acquired confidential U.N. documents that record nearly 7,000 civilian deaths in the no-fire zone up to the end of April. The toll then surged, the paper quoted unidentified U.N. sources as saying, with an average of 1,000 civilians killed each day until May 19, when the government declared victory over the Tamil Tiger rebels. That means the final death toll is more than 20,000, The Times said. \"Higher,\" a U.N. source told the paper. \"Keep going.\" The United Nations has previously said 7,000 civilians were killed in fighting between January and May. A top Sri Lankan official called the 20,000 figure unfounded. Gordon Weiss, a U.N. spokesman in Sri Lanka, told CNN that a large number of civilians were killed -- though he did not confirm the 20,000 figure. \"Up until a certain point, we had very good evidence to show that there were about 7,000 people that were killed,\" he said. \"Then the intense battle kicked in and there were many more deaths, but we didn't know exactly how many. \"Things went really bad\" after the battle began, Weiss said. \"After this, our sources were not able to go out and check those figures. It was based on an extrapolation from what we had seen in the past and also judging from the number of dead bodies that were brought into the hospital.\" The declaration of victory by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought an end to a 26-year civil war. The rebels began their fight for independence for the minority Tamils in July 1983, and since then, at least 70,000 people have died. The fighting intensified at the start of the year. Government troops managed to pin the rebels to a small strip of land in the country's north, a conflict zone that trapped thousands of civilians. Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona called the 20,000 figure \"absolutely unfounded, with no basis of fact.\" He accused the newspaper of bias. \"The Times have been carrying on a campaign and has been using us,\" Kohona told CNN's Don Riddell. \"Sri Lanka succeeded in eliminating a deadly terrorist group and we also rescued 260,000 hostages, and now The Times wants to turn the clock back and make the allegations, which are unfounded.\" Sri Lanka will investigate the number and causes of civilian deaths, Kohona said. \"This is a country where the rule of law prevails and these matters will come out into the open as things settle down,\" he added. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited some of the Sri Lankan refugee camps on Saturday and said they were \"by far the most appalling scenes I have seen.\"",

    "input": "A university professor died of lung cancer aged 37 after doctors repeatedly dismissed her illness as 'purely psychological'. Lisa Smirl, 37, saw three different doctors with a range of symptoms over a year-long period but they were dismissed as anxiety and depression. By the time cancer was finally diagnosed it had spread throughout her body and was terminal. Dr Smirl, who was married to a medical doctor and lived in Leeds and Brighton, kept a heartbreaking online blog about her treatment. Misdiagnosis: Despite Lisa Smirl seeing three doctors with symptoms, her lung cancer was repeatedly written off as 'anxiety and depression' Shortly after her diagnosis, she wrote: 'How is it possible that a 36-year-old, health [obsessed] conscious, occasionally social smoking, middle class, fiance of a doctor can develop metastatic lung cancer unnoticed. How?!? 'What the consultant told us was that not only was it the c-word, but that it was everywhere. 'My brain, my bones, my liver. While in some ways this was a terrible surprise, in another it was a huge relief. 'For the last year I'd been battling a range of bizarre and seemingly disparate symptoms that had forced me in September 2011 to go on sick leave from my job as a lecturer (assistant professor). 'The diagnosis at the time was anxiety and/or depression. And while I was both anxious and depressed, this was due to the increasingly disabling symptoms that my doctor kept insisting were purely psychological. 'So I was actually grateful for a medical diagnosis that confirmed there were objective, physical reasons behind my illness.' Cambridge-educated Dr Smirl, who was originally from Canada, wrote how she first experienced shortness of breath and wheezing in late 2010, which was wrongly diagnosed as asthma. Not psychological: Lisa Smirl said in her blog she was relieved to have a concrete diagnosis even though it was of cancer . In spring 2011, she was referred to a physiotherapist for shoulder and arm pain and started experiencing 'visual migraines' - losing her vision for half an hour - in June. By September 2011, Dr Smirl was so sick she was forced to leave work, having been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and put on anti-depressants. But despite a dramatic weight loss, she claimed three different family doctors refused to consider her symptoms in connection with each other. Relief: Dr Smirl wrote a blog on her diagnosis, saying she was 'actually grateful' for a medical diagnosis that confirmed there were 'objective, physical reasons' behind her symptoms . She wrote: 'Still, despite my pleas, and a dramatic weight loss, none of my doctors (and I saw three different family practitioners) would consider my symptoms in conjunction with one another - insisting that they were all common, unrelated problems (migraines, asthma, depression, back pain).' In November 2011, she misread her asthma prescription and took ten times the recommended amount - but the drug made no difference to a violent cough. Her doctor finally sent her for a routine X-ray and within hours, she was given the devastating news that she had cancer. On her blog, called Stage V - as stage IV of cancer is considered terminal - she describes her journey from 'a woman diagnosed with \"anxiety\" to one with metastatic cancer'. Dr Smirl wrote: 'I can't prove it, and this is just my opinion, but I have no doubt in my own mind that my misdiagnosis was in large part due to the fact that I was a middle aged female and that my male doctors were preconceived towards a psychological rather than a physiological diagnosis. 'It is so easy to say that someone's symptoms are \"anxiety\" related if they are a little bit complicated, unclear or unusual. Don't repeat my mistakes. 'You know when something is wrong. Find another doctor that you connect with and who takes your concerns seriously. Get referrals. Get tested. Refuse to be dismissed.' Dr Smirl worked in the global studies department at the University of Sussex between 2009 and 2012, but took early retirement. Despite battling the disease, she maintained an honorary lectureship in the department until her death on February 21. She also completed a Great North Run to raise funds for the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in November 2012. A blog post from November 3 2012, marking the one year anniversary of Lisa's lung cancer diagnosis . Professor Richard Black, head of the school of global studies at the University of Sussex, led tributes.He said: 'Lisa was a fantastic colleague and friend, a great teacher and researcher and truly inspirational in the way she dealt with her illness.' Professor Justin Rosenberg, head of international relations, added: 'Lisa was an outstanding colleague who shared her intellectual and personal vivacity with academics and students alike.' West Sussex PCT and the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust were unable to confirm that they were involved with Lisa's treatment.",

    "input": "A cancer patient who was forced to have a section of his upper jaw removed has been given an entirely new set of teeth built by a 3D printer. The 41-year-old man, from Bangalore, India, was left unable to eat or speak properly after undergoing the operation when he was diagnosed with mouth cancer. It also left him with large gaps in his teeth that made him feel self-conscious about his appearance. Scroll down for video . New smile: The 41-year-old patient was left with gaps in his teeth, left, following a surgery to treat mouth cancer. A team of scientists were able to give him a new set of teeth, right, to fill in the top row . Realistic: A picture of the mould of the man's mouth, built using a 3D printer, reveals how closely the scientists were able to match the shape and colour of the new set to the patient's original teeth . Self-conscious: The man, from Bangalore, first sought help from dentists to try and fix the gap in the roof of his mouth, left, caused by the surgery. Right: His smile shows the 3D-printed teeth built by scientists . Solution: As well as losing a number of teeth, the patient had a section of the roof of his mouth and part of his jaw removed. Above, the areas that were rebuilt in the 3D printer are coloured to look like his natural mouth . But he is now able to use his mouth with greater ease after a team of scientists used a 3D printer to model and build the section of his jaw that was removed. The patient  had to undergo the surgery in order to remove the cancer in the roof of his mouth. He experienced further complications after developing radiation-induced lockjaw following six weeks of radiotherapy treatment. The condition, which limited his ability to open his mouth, affected his eating and his speech. The upper jaw surgery also had a severe impact on his appearance. Dentists were reluctant to give him any sort of implant, as taking an impression and producing a mould proved problematic given his inability to open his mouth. But a local company that specialises in 3D printing for healthcare became involved in the patient's case. Digital solution: As the man was unable to fully open his mouth to allow doctors to take a conventional mould, a CT scan was used to create a 3D reconstruction of the patient's face, pictured above . Next step: The model of his jaw, pictured above, was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully. This allowed the scientists to make sure that he would have a full range of movement . Perfect fit: Using the 3D-printed replica as a template, a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that it would fit the patient as comfortably as possible. Above, part of the 3D-printed jaw is seen . Treatment: Osteo3D, a Bangladore-based company that specialises in 3D printing for healthcare, became involved in the patient's case after dentists said he could not be fitted with a dental implant . Using a CT scan to create a 3D reconstruction of the patient's face, the company, Osteo3D, printed a replica of the patient's mouth, complete with lower and upper jaw, the defect and his teeth. The model was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully - overcoming the issue of making a mould from the patient's jaw. Using the 3D-printed replica as a template, a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that the fit was correct. This was then hardened, fitted with teeth and given to the patient. He is now able to chew, swallow, speak and smile with greater ease.",

    "input": "Beijing (CNN) -- Demonstrators braved a heavy police presence and the threat of arrest by massing Thursday in the streets of Kunming, China, to protest the planned construction of a chemical plant, they said. \"It was mostly a peaceful protest,\" said an activist who asked to be identified only by his family name, Young. \"We were singing the national anthem, shouting 'Get out, refinery!' together.\" He added, \"We were scattered by the heavy police force in the area. I saw locals scuffling with police, people getting arrested and pulled away.\" Read more: Can social media clear air over China? The plant is a hot topic in the city, which is the capital of Yunnan province in southwestern China. \"Every Kunming person cares about this issue,\" said another Kunming native, a 50-year-old man who said rows of police thwarted his efforts to reach the heart of the protest. \"The police kept blocking off the protest, block by block.\" Local government officials did not respond to CNN phone calls for comment. Photos posted on Chinese social media sites showed uniformed and riot police surrounding groups of demonstrators. The five activists who spoke to CNN asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from Chinese authorities. The oil refinery and chemical plant would be built in Anning city, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Kunming, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. Report: China lax in treating, policing lead poisoning . Opponents fear the chemical plant would produce tons of paraxylene, a carcinogenic chemical identified by the acronym PX. Several days after a May 4 protest, the Kunming mayor joined executives from the state China National Petroleum Corp. and the Yuntianhua Group for a joint news conference. \"The government will call off the project if most of our citizens say no to it,\" said Mayor Li Wenrong, according to Xinhua. The provincial general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. has said the refinery will not use the chemical. \"The project has no PX facilities, nor will it produce PX products,\" Hu Jingke said, according to Xinhua. Kunming residents expressed deep distrust of government officials and the state-owned enterprises behind the refinery project. Several said authorities took draconian measures in the days running up to Thursday's protest in an attempt to prevent demonstrators from taking to the streets. Opinion: Why booming China needs to act fast . A 25-year-old Kunming native who asked to be identified as Claire told CNN that police detained and interrogated her for more than nine hours after she was caught distributing anti-refinery fliers on a city street Tuesday. \"I understand we need oil refineries,\" Claire said in a phone interview. She said she opposed this one because \"it's just so close to the city and the fact that the whole process was not transparent and we're not allowed to ask questions.\" Claire said police accused her of staging an \"illegal gathering.\" As part of the interrogation, she said, police took her to the print shop where she had made copies of her fliers. Then they escorted her to her parents' home, where they demanded that she erase files about the refinery from her computer. Finally, she said, they threatened her and banned her from attending Thursday's protest. CNN Blog: Why China's leaders should worry about climate change . \"Basically, they're saying if I have this on my record, I won't get any government job or state-owned enterprise job,\" Claire said. Several other Kunming residents said students and employees of state-owned companies had been warned not to attend the demonstration. \"Kunming is a beautiful city, where we have cleaner air than any other cities in this country,\" Young said. \"We fear the refinery will destroy the city's natural environment, and we demanded to see the environmental impact assessment report of this project. But we were rejected by the government who told us it's a 'state secret.' \" An executive from Yuntianhua, which also has a major stake in the chemical plant, told journalists that an environmental impact assessment for the project had not been completed, Xinhua said. In March, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao promised that health safeguards would be improved and efforts would be made to control air pollution and make water supplies safer. China air pollution: 'Slightly polluted' or 'hazardous'? \"We should adopt effective measures to prevent and control pollution and change the way we work and live,\" Wen said. The emphasis on environmental and health issues comes as China's leaders confront growing anger about choking pollution, contaminated food, and water that is unsafe to drink. The statistics are staggering. China now burns 3.8 billion tons of coal each year, nearly as much as the rest of the world combined. In January, the smog over Beijing was so thick, it could be seen from space. China's CO2 emissions rose by 720 million tons in 2011 -- a 9.3% increase. Pollution and dust generated in China have been found as far away as California. Maintaining blockbuster growth has sometimes come at the expense of environmental protections. The government has made explicit its intention to weigh environmental regulation against the cost to the economy. But analysts say the public outcry over pollution has tipped the scales. China has already tried to boost the use of alternative sources of power, setting standards for solar energy installation and switching from coal to gas in some cities.

Make-up artist Ashlea Sherman-Wyzard has regularly been mobbed in public due to her likeness to the pint-sized singer. Ashlea, who lives in Monroe, Louisiana, was first told she looked like Minaj by Ray J - Kim Kardashian's ex - and these days the comparisons come thick and fast. Ashlea has not ruled out turning her incredible likeness to the Roman's Revenge singer into a full-time career . ''It's scary sometimes how much they look alike,' her husband says of his wife's resemblance to  Whip It singer . Getting ready for the close-up: The make-up artist has appeared in several music videos . And having appeared in several music videos, she was even turned down for one in which the Superbass singer was due to star - because producers thought she looked too similar. But it isn't only strangers who have trouble telling them apart - even husband Kasheef finds it hard to spot the difference. He said: 'I had a text message from her sister and she made some kind of collage image and the faces were put right against each other and looking at it quickly I thought it was Nicki Minaj, or Nicki Minaj was her. The 28-year-old doesn't mind being stopped and will happily take photos with those shocked by her likeness .

'It's scary sometimes how much they look alike.' But being a mirror image of one of the world's most lusted-after women also has its downsides. The 28-year-old was targeted by Minaj superfans, known as Barbz, after a picture comparing the two was posted online, with Ashlea receiving thousands of abusive tweets - including death threats. She said: 'A lot of Nicki Minaj's fans started to see it and when they saw my name on it, they immediately took to my Twitter and started commenting and harassing me and saying \"Nicki Minaj is this fabulous person, how could you dare compare yourself to her, who do you think you are?\"' But the South Carolina-born Ashlea got through the online bullying with help from her husband of two years Kasheef. The pair even played the Minaj track 'Right By Your Side' at their wedding. Startling resemblance: Ashlea is open to a career as a Nicki Minaj lookalike but she says she 'wouldn't do anything to bash her or make fun of her, or make her look bad.' 'It's been an interesting experience being compared to a celebrity,' Ashlea says . Ashlea admits that both her husband and parents have trouble telling them apart, but is keen to stress that she is her own woman. And while she isn't adverse to surgery, having had a breast reconstruction after a lump was removed, she has ruled out Minaj-style butt implants - at least for the time being.

MailOnline can reveal that in her final words Nancy Motes described the Oscar-winning star as a 'so-called sibling' who should get nothing if she died - except the memory that she pushed her over the edge. In the emotional, handwritten note, Nancy said that Roberts\u2019 abuse had been so bad that \u2018I burst into tears because I wake up\u2019. Scroll down for video . Blame: Julia Roberts step-sister Nancy Motes committed suicide last February. In her final note she wrote, 'I burst into tears every morning b/c (because) I wake up. She was tormented by Julia and called her a b**** . Bitter words: Nancy leaves her 'sister' Julia nothing except the memory that she tormented Nancy . Nancy died of a drug overdose overdose on February 9\u00a0 at the age of 37. Her death was ruled a suicide. The former production assistant on the TV show Glee drowned in a bath surrounded by a mixture of nonprescription and prescription pills, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner. Her fiance John Dilbeck and his family are now engaged in a bitter legal battle with Pretty Woman star Roberts and her mother Betty for control of Nancy's estate. John and his brother Conner say the fight is the latest example of how Roberts tried to manipulate Nancy\u2019s life and control everything. At the center of the row is a suicide note which was found at the scene of Nancy\u2019s death - which can now be revealed for the first time. In the note Nancy begins by saying that \u2018if anything happens to me\u2019 then John gets \u2018whatever he wants of my possessions\u2019 including their dog Lucy. She writes: \u2018My mother and so-called \u2018siblings\u2019 get nothing except the memory that they are the ones that drove me into the deepest depression I\u2019ve ever been in. Class act: At a memorial for Nancy last May, Julia looked grief-stricken. But Nancy claimed in tweets before she died that Julia treated her badly. In one she said: 'Just so you all know, America\u00bfs Sweetheart is a b*****' Bequest: Nancy note said she wanted her jewelry and clothese to go to her closest friends - not her sister and mother . \u2018I have suffered thru this disease all my life, however It has never been this bad. \u2018I burst into tears every morning b/c (because) I woke up.\u2019 The note was filed court papers in relation to probate of Nancy\u2019s estate. It has three sections; one addressed to John, another to her mother Betty and Roberts, and a third addressed to \u2018everyone\u2019. However under California law the Los Angeles County Coroner is only obliged to give the pages to the person to whom they are addressed. Family gathering: Julia greeted well-wishers at a grave site service for Nancy Motes at a service in Smyrna, Georgia in May . Betty and Roberts, 46, have not added their letters to the court file, so they remain private. In the section of the note addressed to John, which is in the file, Nancy praises him as her \u2018one true love\u2019 and tells him she is unworthy of his affections. She begs his forgiveness and says she is \u2018nothing but a junky\u2019 - who will be \u2018better off w/out (without) me\u2019. Nancy writes: \u2018I know this will effect you the most and & I can\u2019t apologize enough. \u2018I was truly blessed & lucky to have you as my true love and best friend. I will carry you with me forever.\u2019 Her final words are: \u2018And I am so sorry\u2019. Love of her life: Nancy left her fiance John Dilbeck her most prized possessions, including her dog Lucky . Battle: Although Nancy declared her wishes in this note,  Dilbeck and his family are now engaged in a bitter legal battle with Pretty Woman star  and her mother Betty for control of her estate . The suicide note reflects the ill feeling that Nancy had towards Roberts which she expressed in a number of Tweets before she died. In one she said: \u2018Just so you all know, America\u2019s Sweetheart is a b*****\u2019 Another read: \u2018Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She\u2019s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally f***** me\u2019. A third angry Tweet read: \u2018(M)y own family has abandoned me\u2019. Motes, originally from Georgia, was the daughter of Roberts\u2019 mother, Betty, 79, and her former stepfather, Michael Motes, 69. Downhill: Julia puts a protective arm around Nancy in this 2002 photo but the sisters had a parting of the ways . Sad goodbye: Nancy's totured last words are a loving tribute to her fiance . Last month Roberts and Betty both attended the service to bury Nancy in Smyrna, Georgia. Reports of what happened are contradictory, with one magazine reporting that Roberts was \u2018very polite and kind\u2019 during the ceremony, which was attended by family and friends. However RadarOnline reported that mourners were stunned by her \u2018bizarre eulogy\u2019. Roberts supposedly said: \u2018 Nancy\u2019s...Gone and not coming back\u2019, according to a source. The source added: \u2018Julia said that, as her sister, she just wanted to \u2018wring\u2019 her neck because she didn\u2019t wait to see the joy that comes with the morning.\u2019 Unwelcome: When Nancy told Julia of her intention to visit their mother Betty in the hospital, Julia reportedly told her:  'Please be gone by 3:30' Nancy\u2019s relationship with her mother and Roberts had long been rocky but fell apart last year after she sold a story to a newspaper about how her famous sister used to tease her about her weight. According to RadarOnline, texts apparently sent between Roberts and Nancy in November of\u00a0 last year relating to their mother\u2019s breast cancer battle underscore just how bad things had become. One from Roberts reads: \u2018If you plan on seeing Mom in the next 2 weeks you should go in the next hour. Thanks.\u2019 Nancy replied: \u2018We\u2019re heading to see her now. Thanks\u2019. In a cold reply, Roberts wrote: \u2018Please be gone by 3:30.\u2019 Last straw: Although she professed her eternal love for Dilbeck, Nancy said she couldn't go on . Just over a week later things became tense when Roberts sent her a message trying to take control of when Nancy would visit. Her message read: \u2018We will text you when Mom\u2019s surgery is scheduled\u2019. Nancy replied: \u2018Mom asked me to come to the hospital. I\u2019m coming.\u2019 But Roberts insisted: \u2018She is asleep. She has to get an x ray and isn\u2019t even admitted to the hospital yet. She is only allowed 1 person with her.\u2019 The texts were from a preview of a documentary called Now That I Have Your Attention, which is about Nancy\u2019s video diaries.

The Trustee Savings Bank is making a comeback almost 20 years after it disappeared from the high street. Lloyds \u2013 which merged with TSB in 1995 \u2013 plans to launch the branches in the summer after the Co-op pulled the plug on a \u00a3750million deal to buy 632 of its banks. The Co-op yesterday said its change of heart was based on the \u2018worsened outlook for economic growth\u2019. Pain: Lloyds was being forced to sell the branches because it received a 2008 bailout from the UK Government and after its Co-op deal collapsed it is turning to the TSB brand . But Lloyds insisted its exit from the . deal will not affect the 4.6million branch customers of Lloyds and . Cheltenham & Gloucester, which is part of the same group, who will . now switch to TSB. Coming back: The 636 branches up for sale are to be re-branded under the TSB symbol last used in 1995 . This will give the new TSB Britain\u2019s eighth largest . network of bank branches. The European Commission had ordered . Lloyds to get rid of the branches by the end of this year as a condition . of receiving a \u00a320billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008. Now that the Co-op deal has fallen through, Lloyds intends to float\u00a0 the revamped TSB brand on the Stock Exchange. But this is unlikely to happen until . next year at the earliest, so bosses will have to appeal to the European . Commission to extend the deadline for offloading the branches. In the meantime, insiders concede that . TSB will effectively be an offshoot of Lloyds, with Lloyds current . accounts, savings, mortgages and investments and staff, although . chequebooks and credit cards will be branded with the TSB logo. Once TSB is floated, it will stand . alone and compete with Lloyds and other lenders. Lloyds, which is 39 per . cent owned by the taxpayer, has seen its reputation plummet after being . rescued by taxpayers during the financial crisis and setting aside . \u00a36.7billion to pay customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. Experts welcomed the relaunch of TSB but expressed dismay at the collapse of the Co-op deal. There were also concerns that TSB would only really be a mini-Lloyds until its flotation. Ministers had hoped the Co-op\u2019s . purchase of the branches would create a big, independent competitor to . the main high street banks. Deal dead: Lloyds Banking Group's sale of more than 600 branches to the Co-operative Group has collapsed . Business Secretary Vince Cable said: . \u2018It is very disappointing. I was really hoping this would happen. We . need more competition and we need more diversity in business lending, . and having the Co-op, a mutual, a new player in small business lending, . would have been a big step forward.\u2019 Barclays Bank said yesterday its first-quarter profit fell a quarter from a year ago after a rise in losses in its European business and a hefty bill for the cost of a restructuring plan by its new chief executive. The London-based giant reported an adjusted pre-tax profit for the three months ended March of \u00a31.79bn down from 2.4bn. It had hoped to make slightly more - \u00a31.85bn. Profits were dented by a \u00a3514m charge to cover costs associated with 'Project Transform', CEO Antony Jenkins' plan to axe 3,700 jobs, prune the investment bank and reform the bank's culture after a series of scandals. Mr Jenkins said yesterday the bank was making good early progress with its overhaul. 'In our goal to become the 'Go-To' bank we have not chosen an easy path for Barclays, but we have chosen the right one,' he said. Consumer campaigner Richard Lloyd, . executive director of Which?, said: \u2018This is very bad news for everyone . wanting to see more competition in retail banking. \u2018This would have given more choice to . consumers who are sick and tired of shoddy service and unfair fees and . put more pressure on the big banks to work for customers, not bankers.\u2019 TSB grew from humble beginnings to . become a major player on the high street, famous for its slogan, \u2018The . bank that likes to say Yes\u2019. The first trustee savings bank was . established in 1810 by Reverend Henry Duncan, of Ruthwell in . Dumfriesshire, so his poorest parishioners could save for times of . hardship.

Jury selection is finally scheduled to begin tomorrow in Miami for the 2007 murder of All-Pro safety Sean Taylor, after numerous delays. Eric Rivera, now 23, was only 17 at the time of the shooting but faces life in prison for first-degree murder instead of the death penalty if convicted. Jury selection is expected to take four days. There have already been at least . seven previous trial dates set for Rivera. Cooley, for one, said it's . time for justice to be done. Redskins football player Sean Taylor, pictured in 2004, was murdered in 2007 during a violent home invasion in Florida . The last trial date was postponed . when Rivera fired his\u00a0 attorney, meaning his new lawyer required more . time to work on his case. Nearly . six years ago, Redskins player Sean Taylor was at home nursing an . injury instead of taking the field with his Washington teammates for a . road game at Tampa. A group of young men from southwest Florida drove across the state intending to burglarize Taylor's Miami-area home, thinking he wouldn't be home. When the 6-foot-2, 230-pound player, well known as a ferocious hitter, confronted them with a machete early on Nov. 26, 2007, Eric Rivera Jr. allegedly fired two shots. One missed. The other hit Taylor in the upper leg, causing massive blood loss that led to his death a day later at age 24. Four other people were also charged in the case. One of them, Venjah Hunte, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and burglary charges and is expected to testify against Rivera. The other three are scheduled to go to trial later on lesser charges. Hunte's plea deal calls for a 29-year prison term instead of life. Although Taylor had some run-ins with the law and been fined several times by the NFL for various rules violations, his future seemed extremely bright before he was killed. Eric Rivera, pictured in 2007 after his arrest, faces charges of first degree murder . The son of Florida City Police Chief Pedro Taylor and an All-American player at the University of Miami, the Redskins drafted Taylor with the fifth overall pick in the 2004 draft and he signed an $18 million contract. Taylor quickly became a starter and was nicknamed 'Meast' by teammates, a combination of man and beast, because of his hard-hitting style. He was named to the Pro Bowl after the 2006 season and was also very popular among Redskins players and fans. One of his best friends, wide receiver Santana Moss, said he still says 'a little prayer' for Taylor every time he takes the field. 'I have a few people that have passed away in my life as friends that have meant something to me, and I'm always constantly speaking to them. That's just something I do. He's one of those guys,' Moss said. The Redskins contributed $500,000 to a fund for Taylor's young daughter after he died and, in the first game after his slaying, the team's defense took the field against Buffalo with only 10 players on the first play \u2014 leaving Taylor's free safety position vacant to honor him. Fans at that game got towels bearing his number, 21. To many fans, players and others connected with both the Redskins and the U' at Miami, it was heartbreaking to see such a talented player's life and career cut short so brutally. 'He was a young man who was learning quickly how to be a great human being, and, to me, he was the best football player I've ever seen in person,' said former Redskins tight end Chris Cooley, a nine-year veteran who now does broadcasts for the team. 'He was the most physical, the most gifted, the hardest-working guy that I've been around, and it was such an unfortunate thing.' Former Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, now a NASCAR racing team owner, said Taylor began to mature and take a leadership role on the team after the birth of his daughter. 'It wound up being a true tragedy and it had a huge effect on all of us,' Gibbs said of Taylor's killing. 'He was one of those guys that with the way he played and his persona the way he was, he was a natural leader. You could see guys look to him from a leadership standpoint.' The fatal attempted burglary was not the first time there was a break-in at Taylor's home. Police say someone pried open a window a few days earlier, on Nov. 17, and rifled through a desk and other belongings. No one was home that time, and it's not clear exactly what, if anything, was taken. Free Safety Sean Taylor of the Washington Redskins seen playing against the New York Jets in November 2007 - just three weeks before he died . Then came the weekend after Thanksgiving with the Redskins playing the Buccaneers that Sunday. Taylor was given permission to stay home with a knee injury, along with his girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, and their 18-month-old daughter, also named Jackie. Police say two of the men charged had connections to Taylor: Jason Scott Mitchell had cut Taylor's lawn and an older cousin of suspect Charles Wardlow had dated Taylor's sister. Family members also said Mitchell had recently been at a birthday party at Taylor's house, where Taylor was known to keep large amounts of cash. Miami-Dade County's former police director, Robert Parker, said the defendants were surprised to find Taylor home early that Monday morning. 'They were certainly not looking to go there and kill anyone,' Parker said. 'They were expecting a residence that was not occupied.' Authorities say they have obtained confessions from at least some of the suspects, all from the Fort Myers area, but pretrial hearings on whether those statements will be allowed in Rivera's trial were closed by Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy. The judge also imposed a gag order on prosecutors and defense attorneys in hopes of limiting pretrial news media coverage that could make jury selection difficult. The murder weapon has never been found. Prosecutors say it was thrown into the Everglades after the slaying while the group drove home across Alligator Alley. 'Breaking into someone's home, into their personal safety blanket and shooting them in that environment is the most heinous, unthinkable crime that could have happened to a guy like Sean. It's despicable,' Cooley said.",

Malala, the Pakistani girl who made a miraculous recovery after being shot in the head by the Taliban, said women are targeted by those who fear a society in which women are empowered. Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls, an act that has become the focal point of a worldwide social media campaign demanding their return. The Malala Fund is launching a Nigerian girls education campaign around the issue. The 16-year-old human rights advocate first spoke up about the kidnappings last week. \"When I heard about girls in Nigeria being abducted, I felt very sad, and I thought, 'my sisters are imprisoned now,'\" Malala said. \"The girls in Nigeria are my sisters and its my responsibility that I speak up for my sisters.\" Boko Haram are extremists who don't understand Islam, she said. The religion, she says, calls for empowerment through education, not a snuffing of it. \"They should go and they should learn Islam, and I think that they should think of these girls as their own sisters. How can one imprison their own sisters and treat them in such a bad way?\" she said. Everyone should speak up for the kidnapped girls, she said. In a photo released on social media, Malala holds a sign reading #BringBackOurGirls, joining the chorus of social media activity repeating the same demand. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been under fire over accusations the government initially ignored and then later downplayed the abduction of the girls. Jonathan has also accepted an offer of U.S. military support in the search for the girls. Why hasn't the rescue effort produced results?",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A former Massachusetts chemist has indicated she will plead guilty to charges stemming from an investigation into how she allegedly mishandled sensitive evidence affecting thousands of state criminal cases dating to 2003, according to a source with knowledge of the agreement. In an open door lobby conference last week, Annie Dookhan asked prosecutors and the judge overseeing her case what the ramifications would be if she were to change her plea from not guilty to guilty, according to the source. Prosecutors indicated they would seek a minimum of a five- to seven-year sentence if Dookhan were to plead guilty. Her lawyer, Nicholas Gordon, asked for a one-year maximum sentence, according to the source. \"After consideration of the submissions of the parties and the arguments of counsel before this judge on October 18, 2013, I have decided that, if the defendant were to plead guilty before me, I would not exceed a sentence of three to five years in state prison, with a probationary term to follow,\" Suffolk Superior Court Justice Carol Ball said, according to court documents. Dookhan, 34, is facing 27 counts, including obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. The list of defendants whose cases could be affected by the alleged drug tampering by the former Massachusetts chemist has grown to more than 40,000, according to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration. Dookhan worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from 2003 until March 2012, when she resigned, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. The attorney general's office began a criminal investigation in July 2012, after Massachusetts State Police were tipped off by Dookhan's co-workers, who alleged her work might be unreliable. The investigation revealed that Dookhan allegedly had tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab, allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely \"dry labbing\" samples. \"Dry labbing\" is a term used for visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test. Authorities arrested Dookhan at her home in Franklin, Massachusetts, in September 2012. Dookhan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. In a statement from the Massachusetts attorney general's office, spokesman Brad Puffer said: \"It is the defendant's decision whether or not to plead guilty and the judge's decision to determine the sentence. Our office has not agreed to any plea deal and we are prepared to go to trial and prove our case before a jury. The defendant has indicated to the court that she will likely change her plea to guilty.\" A hearing in Dookhan's case that was scheduled for Wednesday has been canceled. A new change of plea hearing has been scheduled for November 22, when Dookhan is expected to plead guilty. Dookhan's attorney, Nicholas Gordon, could not be reached for comment Monday.

A mother-of-three has survived deadly meningitis three times after the bug infiltrated her brain via a hole in her skull. Janine Blackhurst, now 39, was first struck down with meningitis when she was five and then went to catch different strains when she was 33 and then 37, just weeks before her wedding day. It was not until the third bout that doctors discovered the hole in her skull, next to her sinuses, that was exposing her brain to the bacterial and viral infections. Janine, 39, (pictured on her wedding day in 2011) has survived meningitis three times. She married shortly after her third encounter with the deadly condition which left her temporarily unable to walk. Three months after her wedding she underwent surgery to close the hole in her skull that was making her prone to the infection . Mrs Blackhurst caught the meningococcus strain of the bug when she was five-years-old. She responded well to treatment and made a full recovery. She then enjoyed good health - apart from frequent colds and flu - until October 2007, when she was rushed to hospital again. Mrs Blackhurst, then 33, was diagnosed with meningitis again but this time it was the pneumococcal strain. She said: 'I thought I\u2019d been unlucky to get it the first time so I couldn\u2019t believe it when they said I had it again.' After spending two weeks in hospital on strong antibiotics, she was finally allowed home. Tests showed Janine had a weak immune system and doctors believed that she had probably contracted meningitis a second time because of this. She was given a series of injections to help boost her immune system. But in 2011 - and just weeks before she was due to marry her partner Stephen Blackhurst, 34 - she was struck down with the same strain of the bug again. Janine (pictured with husband Stephen on their honeymoon) was born with a small hole in her skull which opportunistic bacteria used as a gateway to her brain. When she caught meningitis for the third time, paramedics said her temperature was so high that 'she was cooking inside' Janine, who works in a chip shop, said: 'I developed what I thought was a migraine and took myself to bed only to wake at 6am with the worst pains in my head I\u2019d ever experienced. 'By the time the ambulance arrived, I was fitting and lashing out. The paramedics couldn\u2019t do anything with me. 'I\u2019d become violent as well because of the temperature and I wasn\u2019t responding to the medication they were giving me. 'They then rang for a doctor to come from the hospital to sedate me so they could get me out of the house.' Paramedics told her worried daughter, Bobbi-Jo Caffery, 19, that her mother\u2019s temperature was so high, she was \u2018cooking from the inside out.\u2019 At hospital, doctors kept her in a darkened room and ran brain scans. Initially, they thought Janine had suffered a brain haemorrhage but a lumbar puncture revealed she actually had pneumococcal meningitis. Ms Blackhurst's eye became paralysed shut as the infection took hold. Initially, doctors thought Janine had suffered a brain haemorrhage but a lumbar puncture revealed she actually had meningitis for a third time . Ms Blackhurst said she lokoed as if she had suffered a stroke. When she woke from her coma, she could not talk, walk or feed herself . Mrs Blackhurst was immediately given . intravenous antibiotics to fight the infection and spent eight . days in a coma in intensive care while doctors battled to save her. When she woke up, she couldn\u2019t talk, walk or feed herself. She said: 'All my left side seemed to be worse and my left eye wouldn\u2019t open. I looked like I\u2019d had a stroke. 'All I wanted to do was go home as I was due to get married in ten weeks. I was devastated. We\u2019d cancelled the wedding once already back in 2009. 'I told Stephen to call it off but he, Bobbi-Jo and my gran persuaded me to change my mind. 'It was something to work towards. I was determined to get myself better. Everything was organised and paid for.' Brain scans showed that Mrs Blackhurst had a very small hole in her skull (right) which had made her brain prone to infection. During surgery to fix the hole they then discovered that a small amount of brain had grown through the skull which had had to be removed . It was at this point that doctors discovered Janine had a . hole in her skull, just behind her sinuses. They believed that this had exposed her brain to both the bacterial and viral forms of meningitis. To close the hole in Mrs Blackhurst's head, surgeons removed bone from her leg (pictured after doctors extracted a small amount of bone) and grafted it onto the skull . After three weeks in hospital, Mrs Blackhurst was discharged and with the help of physiotherapy she took her first steps. She was referred to a specialist who told her she needed an operation to fill the hole to reduce the risk of her contracting meningitis again - and they could use bone from her leg to do it. Janine decided to go ahead with the wedding and doctors agreed to postpone theoperation. She said: 'It was a lovely day especially considering I nearly didn\u2019t make it. It was emotional for me but I think even more so for Stephen and my family as they were the ones who had to see me so ill.' A month later, Janine went into hospital for the operation. Surgeons were left stunned when what they initially thought might be a polyp, an abnormal growth, in her left nostril was actually piece of her brain that had grown through the hole. Janine said: 'It had grown through the hole and died so they cut it out. I couldn\u2019t quite believe it when they told me. It was weird. Having a defect in the skull which exposes the brain to infection is not unheard off, according to specialist research and education manager Jane Blewitt of the Meningitis Trust. She said: 'A group of pneumococcal bacteria that cause minor infections are very opportunistic and have been known, on rare occasions, to use a small hole in the skull as a gateway to the brain.' Mrs Blackhurst was in hospital for five days and was then released with dressings packed into my nose to keep the bone graft in place.' A week later, doctors confirmed the operation had been a success. Janine said: 'It was such a relief. 'I wasn\u2019t well enough to go on the honeymoon so we had to postpone. We\u2019ve just got back home. We went to Majorca and it was well worth the wait. 'I\u2019m so lucky because things could have been very different. I\u2019m lucky to be alive.'

It was unclear whether he was shot by both officers . After the first shots were fired, the man got up and headed back toward the terminal, at which point a second airport officer shot him, Weiner said. It was unclear whether he was shot by both officers. He was shot multiple times, Weiner said. Police are investigating the man's background and why he was using a fake ID to buy a ticket. He tried at one point to use a woman's ID, Weiner said. 'At this point this is just a violent encounter between an armed man and the officers here,' the sergeant said. Surveillance video, which was not released, will show what happened, he said. An SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad as a precaution, Whitaker had said. The incident caused delays of just over an hour during the search of the man's vehicle, when portions of the ticket lobby were cordoned off and a checkpoint to a Delta concourse was closed, said Elaine Roberts, president and chief executive officer of Columbus Regional Airport Authority. Departing passengers who normally would be dropped off on the level where the shooting happened were redirected to a lower level. The confrontation occurred after the officer called a tow truck for the man's vehicle, which he left illegally parked in the departures area. The airport and the Transportation Security Administration prohibit unauthorized vehicles in the departures area, Roberts said, adding the shooting was the first such incident in the airport's history. 'We are very pleased that we are back to a normal state for passengers,' she said.

Shriner, the owner of a towing business, said he was called to the airport to haul away an illegally parked car. When he pulled up outside the departures area, Shriner said he saw a man fighting with two officers and heard two shots fired. The suspect went down, but then got back up and proceeded to advance on the two officers who had their guns drawn but were retreating. Precaution: An\u00a0SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad . The man pointed at his waistband, but Shriner said he did not see a gun there. One of the uniformed cops struck the suspect with a baton on his legs before the third officer arrived and shot him dead. Shriner speculated that he may have been called to the airport to tow the slain suspect's SUV from the terminal. Matt Diehl of Columbus was waiting to board a flight in a growing crowd.

The male model who last week accused Kevin Clash, the voice of Elmo, of having sex with him while he was underage stands by his story, claims he was pressured into recanting it, and is now seeking legal advice on how to undo his settlement. The $125,000 settlement was struck between the two men several hours before the accuser, Sheldon Stephens, 23, officially retracted his underage sex allegation. Under the terms of the settlement, if Stephens is asked by anyone about his relationship with Clash, he must repeat only the following statement: 'He [Stephens] wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with Mr. Clash was an adult consensual relationship.' Scandal on Sesame Street: Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, has resigned amid growing accusations that he slept with underage boys . Sheldon Stephens now wishes to undo the $125,000 settlement that he signed last week with Clash's lawyers . Stephens reportedly cried during final . negotiations with Clash's lawyer and repeatedly insisted he didn't . want to sign. He has apparently met with . lawyers in Los Angeles and told them he was pressured into recanting his . allegation and insists he's telling the truth when he says he had sex . with Clash when he was 16, reports TMZ. Stephens, a struggling actor/model, is now telling lawyers he will gladly forfeit the $125,000 settlement to restore his name. Accusations that Clash, who is openly gay, engaged in an underage sexual affair set off a media firestorm after they were revealed last Monday. Within 24 hours of the story breaking, Stephens recanted his claim. After Stephens withdrew his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a . spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to . rest. I will not discuss it further.' Since the scandal broke, Clash, 52, . has taken a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the . popular children's TV show on PBS. Resignation: Clash has left the popular children's show but that doesn't mean it's the end of the road for Elmo . Model: Sheldon Stephens, 23 of Pennsylvania, accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex with him when he was underage . Clash, 52, had been on a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop since the scandal broke . Andreozzi & Associates, the law firm representing Stephens, did not return requests for comment from MailOnline. On his Twitter account, Stephens describes himself as an . 'entrepreneur, student, model [and] actor.' On . his Facebook page, he writes, 'I like to consider myself a rare breed. I'm very spontaneous and random\u2026 I'm determined and goal oriented. My . destiny is laid on a solid gold brick pathway... MY FUTURE IS BRIGHT and . never will it dim.' Court records show Stephens has . been arrested several times since 2009 on charges including writing a . bad check and reckless driving. His most serious charges were in . September of 2009, when he was arrested at an airport in his hometown of Pennsylvania . after stepping off a flight from Los Angeles. He was charged in that arrest with robbing his former employer, Darian Pollard, at knife-point. Pollard accused Stephens of stealing a $250,000 'white gold necklace with diamonds' and a 'white gold ring with diamond baguettes' and then boarding a flight to Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint. Stephens was wearing the jewelry when police arrested him and he insisted that the pieces were gifts. Charges filed against him in Pennsylvania were later dropped, however, and charges were never filed in California. Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologized for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.' The puppeteer told the man almost 30 years his junior . that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New . York, it has emerged. The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual . relationship with the accuser, but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult. In emails sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.' He added: 'I want you to know that I love . you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure . your dreams come true... 'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.' Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply . saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.' Iconic: Clash, left, who has voiced Elmo for two decades, admits he had a relationship with the man, but only once the accuser was an adult . The . accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers. In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a . letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit . the victim in order to protect its . employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.' The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of . a young man.' Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was . unsubstantiated after a thorough . investigation. They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received. TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, . acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the . accuser never mentioned such an email existed. In the spotlight: The Sesame Workshop called the controversy 'a distraction that none of us want' Sesame Street disciplined Clash . for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to . the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual . relationship. They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed . his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said. Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards. He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials. He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Packaging can change how people see things. And when it comes to sex, it could maybe help save lives too. The Center for African Family Studies (CAFS), a Nairobi-based international NGO, has teamed up with Kenyan artist Michael Soi to create an eye-catching condom line with pop art-inspired packaging to promote safe sex and raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. The group has turned to crowdsourcing website Indiegogo to raise funds for its campaign, which aims to encourage condom usage among local youth in a country where an estimated 1.6 million people struggle with HIV/AIDS. \"They were giving out free condoms when I went to the HIV conference in Cape Town recently,\" says CAFS director of operations Jonathan Spangler. \"These condoms were brightly colored, like nothing seen in Kenya -- glow in the dark, different flavors, different prints. We put a picture of them on Facebook and we had youth calling us up asking where they could purchase them,\" he adds. \"We've never had that sort of reaction to CAFS programs. So we said why don't we try produce our own condom line because there seems to be a market. We want to innovate and create new programming that is sustainable and even generates income for the youth,\" he adds.. Stigma vs. safety . HIV/AIDS continues to be one of the most prominent public health obstacles many African countries face today. In recent years, the disease -- which had reached epidemic proportions -- has started to decline in Kenya as a result of stronger public awareness campaigns and the impact of local education programs. While the outlook is positive, campaigners say more needs to be done to continue to reduce the threat of HIV/AIDS in the country -- a start could be made by tackling the stigma surrounding the purchase of condoms. \"Most people are actually very afraid of going to vendors in supermarkets and chemists to buy condoms because we are a fairly reserved society,\" explains Genevieve Imbali, communications and marketing officer at CAFS. \"Most people aren't very open to the idea that very young people might walk into a shop just to buy condoms because nobody wants to be known to be having sex ... There is so much stigma associated with condom purchase in the country.\" Eye-catching designs . To address this, the bright packaging of CAFS' colored condoms is specifically designed to disguise the product inside. Imbali explains that by making condoms less obvious, more people will be willing to buy them. She also says that the condoms currently available in the country are either too expensive or low quality -- issues, she claims, will be tackled with the CAFS condom line. \"For the condoms that are given out for free at schools, the youth still do not take them,\" argues Imbali. \"They look at them and think: 'You know what, you are giving this for free but they are not good quality.' So they'd probably just have unprotected sex rather than use the ones that are easily accessible.\" Collaborating with artists . But getting an artist to agree to provide designs for the packaging became a struggle. Many didn't want their work associated with sex and CAFS hit a roadblock -- until they met with Michael Soi. The Nairobi-based artist is well-known for his bold, but often controversial, themes placed within his paintings. Unafraid to shy away from taboo subjects like sex and interracial relationships, Soi was more than happy to collaborate with the NGO. \"I felt like everybody is basically trying to deal with this whole issue -- HIV, unwanted pregnancies -- and when I talk about everybody I mean the church is doing whatever they can, the government is doing whatever they can,\" says Soi. \"I felt the project was a good thing. I wanted to try to chip in and create something that would help fight a good fight,\" he says. Soi explains that sex isn't discussed openly and that as a result many young people learn about the dangers of unprotected sex the hard way -- through experience. However, he does believe awareness is increasing and he hopes his work will continue to change attitudes surrounding sex in Kenya. \"I think it's important to try and play a part and make sure that people will not go through the same mistakes as what my generation has gone through.\" READ THIS: How medics saved lives at Westgate .

    "input": "(CNN) -- The teen who stunned the world of tennis Tuesday from Wimbledon's Centre Court, beating Rafael Nadal in an audacious, four-set victory laced with fun and brazen moves, has had his fairytale first Wimbledon brought to an close. Nick Kyrgios' run came to an abrupt halt Wednesday, with Milos Raonic, the No. 8 seed from Canada, disposing of the young Australian, 6-7 6-2 6-4 7-6. But the 19-year-old from Canberra's achievement will live on as one of the shocks of the tournament. To meet tennis world number one Rafael Nadal on the court at Wimbledon in his first appearance there, and to not only triumph, but to do so with an assortment of tricks, including an opening ace and a sublime between-the-legs flick that left the Spanish great dumbfounded, counts as a memorable introduction. \"Never did I think a week ago I was going to make the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in my first appearance,\" the wild-card entry, ranked 144 in the world, said in a press conference after taking this famous scalp. Heightened expectations . Until his win over Nadal, he was likely content to experience the tournament, play his Xbox -- which he brought with him from Australia -- and hang out with his father and sister, who accompanied him to London. He said he'd text his mother a smiley face after the press event ended. Now, expectations are somewhat heightened. On court, Kyrgios carries himself confidence and verve that belies his 19 years of age, as his unorthodox, Nadal-stumping shot clearly demonstrated. After besting the five-time finalist over four sets, the world has been alerted to Australian tennis' worst-kept secret, a serial winner -- and world junior number 1 -- at youth level who is taking his senior career in his stride. Many are tipping the right-handed, attacking baseliner as a future great of the game. It's not an Aussie fairytale without precedent, however. In 1996, at another Grand Slam event, a young Mark Philippoussis -- an Australian who also boasts Greek heritage -- knocked out then-number 1 Pete Sampras to reach the fourth round. \"That's what it reminded me of, where (Kyrgios) just didn't go away -- he kept going for the shots and kept coming up with the goods,\" Australian great Pat Cash told the Sydney Morning Herald. \"It was extremely impressive. It was amazing. It was almost faultless.\" He started playing at six, and his background -- Greek-Australian on his father's side and Malaysian on his mother's -- is emblematic of multicultural, modern Australia, and currently divides his time between his hometown of Canberra and Melbourne, the spiritual home of Australian tennis. He's at home on grass -- something that cannot necessarily be said for his erstwhile opponent, who has endured a torrid time at Wimbledon in recent years. Becker comparison . After his phenomenal win over Nadal, comparisons are plenty, given the number of precocious talents who have graced Centre Court. But perhaps the most flattering is with the great Boris Becker, who as an unsmiling Teutonic 17-year old beat the South African Kevin Curren in the 1985 final, the first of his three Wimbledon titles. \"We keep saying 'who's the next guy?' and I think that we've found that guy,'' former Wimbledon champion and current commentator John McEnroe told the BBC. \"It was absolutely stunning, what he did to the world number 1. \"He absolutely believed that he was going to win this match, and he's acting, to me, like he can win this tournament. The last guy I saw like this... is Boris Becker. That young teenager, no fear whatsoever, no matter what comes my way I'm going to be better than them.'' McEnroe's confidence in Kyrgios' ability to go all the way may have fallen flat for now, but for a 19-year-old in his first pro season, defeating one of tennis' all-time greats still counts as a remarkable success, and he will be relishing his return to the scene in a year's time.",

'We\u2019re trying to be mindful and respectful of their feelings, even though they\u2019re supportive of what we both do,' said Christianna. Instead, she and her finance have decided to throw a joint (pardon the pun) bridal shower with a variety of weed sweets and edibles involved. With smoking outlawed in many venues, marijuana-infused drinks and snacks may well be the best way for people to ingest their now legal high in the future.

Members of the Unite union working for dnata at the three airports had been due to walk out tomorrow, but will be balloted on revised proposals. Unite regional officer Kevin Hall said: 'Unite is pleased to confirm that strike action has been suspended following a revised offer which better reflects the contribution our members make to the company. Unite union had called for peace talks to avoid disruption at airports on December 23 and 24, and thankfully it appears some common ground has been reached . 'All of this could have been avoided if the company hadn't refused requests to negotiate and go to ACAS a number of weeks ago.

A spokesperson for dnata told TravelMole: 'During dnata's recent discussions with Unite and ACAS, the two parties have come to an agreement on the salary award for dnata's Unite members. Unite has accepted dnata's offer of an increase in salary of 2.25 per cent, and a one-time payment of \u00a3175 for all employees.'

Scientists performing CT scans on the head of an Egyptian mummy say they have found one of the worst cases of dental problems ever seen - an a unique treatment to try and treat it. Researchers CT scanning a 2,100 year old mummy were stunned to find evidence of a sinus infection caused by a mouthful of cavities and other tooth problems. The also came across a unique find - a cavity filled with linen. Researchers used a CT scanner to see inside the man's mouth, and created a 3D reconstruction showing the worn incisors . Using a piece of linen, which may have . first been dipped in a medicine such as fig juice or cedar oil, a form . of 'packing' in the biggest and most painful cavity, located on the left . side of his jaw between the first and second molars, was inserted. This acted as a barrier to prevent food particles from getting . into the cavity, with any medicine on the linen helping to ease the . pain, the study researchers said. The man, whose name is unknown, was in . his 20s or early 30s, and lived at a time when Egypt was ruled by a . dynasty of Greek kings. Andrew Wade, at the University of . Western Ontario, used new high-resolution CT scans of his teeth and . body, according to the . International Journal of Paleopathology. Researchers said this is the first . known case of such packing treatment done on an ancient Egyptian. 'The . dental treatment, filling a large inter-proximal cavity [a cavity . between two teeth] with a protective, likely medicine-laden, barrier is a . unique example of dental intervention in ancient Egypt,' the team . writes in their journal article. 'The dental packing described here is unique among ancient Egyptian . mummies studied to date, and represents one of only a few recorded . dental interventions in ancient Egypt. CT scans of the entire mouth were carried out to allow the researchers to recreate a 3D version. The linen filling can be be seen on the right of the mouth . Dentistry was relatively commonplace in Egypt, . and records indicate that it was being practiced at least as far . back as when the Great Pyramids were built. However, this finding has led researchers to believe experts may have practiced advanced techniques. Dental problems were not unusual, as the coarsely ground grain ancient Egyptians consumed was not good for the teeth. The team say the find add weight to the theory that dentists were commonplace in Egypt. 'Such a finding lends further support for the existence of a group of . dental specialists practicing interventional medicine in ancient Egypt. 'While the physical evidence, to date for other interventions, may be . scarce, the findings presented here should underline the need to . continue to look for evidence of dental packing as well as other . therapeutic dental interventions in the ancient world.' The . small linen mass was initially found during a scan in the mid-1990s, . but the scanning resolution of the time was too low to allow a full . analysis. The high-resolution scanner his team used for their latest study was six times as powerful.

The man, whose name is unknown, was in his 20s or early 30s, and had 'numerous' abscesses and cavities, conditions that appear to have resulted, at some point, in a sinus infection, something potentially deadly, the study researchers said, although they could not pinpoint his cause of death. The 3D reconstruction was made from data collected during high resolution CT scans of the mummy. When he died he was mummified, his brain and many of his organs taken out, resin put in and his body wrapped.

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- A group of union-backed organizations joined the loosely defined Occupy Wall Street movement again Tuesday, leaving behind the confines of New York's financial district for the posh neighborhoods that dot Manhattan's Upper East Side, according to multiple group representatives. Crowds also swelled in Lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, where demonstrators waved placards and chanted slogans attacking corporate greed and social inequality. The union-organized march, meanwhile, took protesters past the homes of well-to-do residents like billionaire David Koch, News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Organizations such as UnitedNY, the Strong Economy for All Coalition, the Working Families Party, and New York Communities for Change were accompanied by protesters typically based in Zuccotti Park, a privately owned park in New York's financial district. The Upper East Side march was \"in support\" of the Occupy Wall Street movement, but was not organized by it, said T.J. Helmstetter, a spokesman for Working Families Party, a coalition of New York community and labor groups. Protesters hopped on the subway, emerging at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street near Central Park, where organizers held a press conference that addressed both New York-centric themes, such as state taxes, and the movement's broader concerns of social inequity. \"We are the 99%,\" the group chanted, a reference to their insistence that most Americans lack the influence in their country's political and financial affairs enjoyed by the elite 1%. \"I think it's time that these people realize that people are hurting in this country and it's time to reform what's going on in Washington,\" said New York resident Lenore Silverstein, who attended Tuesday's march. Emily Monroe , a North Carolina college student and marcher, said the city's wealthiest \"are buying billion-dollar apartments and living lavishly, while we are just trying to sustain ourselves.\" \"The American dream is no longer possible because these people are stealing from the middle class,\" she told CNN Radio. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, meanwhile, said authorities will defend protesters' right to demonstrate, but he doesn't appreciate \"the bashing of all of the hardworking people who live and work here.\" \"Our city depends on the jobs that the financial services industry provides,\" Bloomberg said during a news conference in the Bronx. He added that he didn't understand what the picketing of wealthy and prominent New Yorkers is intended to achieve. The mayor's comments coincided with a state comptroller report released Tuesday that predicts Wall Street could lose an additional 10,000 jobs by the end of next year, raising the total number of jobs lost in the securities industry since 2008 to 32,000. Earlier, in Boston, 129 protesters were arrested during a similar demonstration Tuesday, mostly for \"unlawful assembly and trespassing,\" said police spokesman Eddy Chrispin. The group allegedly blocked traffic and refused to disperse while marching to \"areas of the city where they hadn't been previously,\" he said. Protesters have been occupying Dewey Square Park in downtown Boston, but expanded to the neighboring Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway on Monday night. Protesters were given a 1:30 a.m. deadline to move back to Dewey Square. Those who did not were arrested. The nationwide Occupy movement has been largely peaceful, though it has led to some skirmishes with police and arrests. It has also stoked fervent public debate, including among politicians. Democrats have generally offered sympathy for protesters' concerns while several Republicans, among them 2012 presidential candidates Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich, have described the demonstrations as \"class warfare.\" The movement shows few signs of slowing down. Rallies and marches have been held in numerous towns and cities in recent days, with many more planned. That includes a \"Call to Action Against Banks\" planned for Saturday, which New York's Occupy Wall Street announced on its Facebook site. \"No longer will banks take our homes. No longer will banks rob students of our future. No longer will banks destroy the environment. No longer will banks fund the misery of war. No longer will banks cause massive unemployment. And no longer will banks create and profit from economic crisis without a struggle,\" according to the online message Monday. It then urges people to \"visit your local Bank of America, Wells Fargo or Chase (branches) and let them know, we will not allow business as usual.\" \"We. Will. Occupy. Everywhere,\" the posting ends. CNN Radio's Steve Kastenbaum, CNNMoney's Charles Riley and CNN's Marina Landis contributed to this report .",

Thousands of women are clamouring to sign up for a designer foundation that claims to use space-age technology to keep it working for 24 hours. Nearly 12,000 women are already on the waiting list for Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s Fusion Foundation \u2013 three weeks before it is released nationwide. The hi-tech make-up contains a material called lipophilic acid, which is used to capture space dust. This interstellar ingredient makes the product the most technologically advanced make-up in the world, say YSL. The microscopic substance absorbs grease from the face, leaving an even, matte surface for up to 24 hours. This is because the lipophilic acid has a honeycomb-shaped texture, allowing it to absorb up to four times its own weight in moisture, it is claimed. The formula also contains a \u2018hydrophilic agent\u2019 \u2013 a clay-like mix of minerals which acts like \u2018an invisible sponge\u2019, soaking up moisture from the face, as well as a \u2018beautyleaf extract\u2019 designed to mimic the fatty acids found on the surface of the skin. Caroline Negre, YSL's scientific communications director, said: 'Fusion Foundation is a ground-breaking response to modern demands for trustworthy, perfect coverage that lasts for up to 24 hours without compromising on texture. 'This combination of active agents is a first for Yves Saint Laurent Beaut\u00e9. Fusion Foundation contains a new blend of hydrophilic and lipophilic agents and tamanu oil. 'This hybrid technology means the volatile oils in the foundation evaporate quickly after application - leaving just the pigments and actives behind on the skin.' Created by Yves Saint Laurent Beaut\u00e9 skincare laboratory in Paris, the formula contains 'pure, milled pigments each with a micro-coating that merges perfectly with the surface of the skin, thus ensuring it remains uniform, weightless and long-wearing,' YSL said. Model Cara Delevingne, the face of the new YSL product:\u00a0The hi-tech make-up contains a material called lipophilic acid, which is apparently more commonly used to capture space dust . Creative director of make-up at YSL, Lloyd Simmonds, said: 'Other formulas tend to be quite thick in texture, a little heavy and form a barrier on the skin. This has a lightness of texture which is completely new. 'As a make-up artist, my criteria for foundation are that I don't want to see it on the skin, it has to be invisible and weightless. 'So the aim was to create a weightless formula with an invisible, long-lasting coverage and that's what we have. It has a natural-looking, mattifying effect on the skin - without appearing dry or caked on. And it lasts the entire day.' YSL claimed that unlike other foundations, this product is not too heavy and will not form an impenetrable barrier over the skin. The dispenser for the foundation was inspired by the way a calligrapher would dip his quill in a pot of ink, which YSL said was designed to eliminate the fashion faux-pas of applying too much make-up. It said the dispenser's plume is fanned at the base and tapered at the tip, which it says allows the optimum amount of foundation onto the skin without any surplus. The foundation will be available exclusively from Debenhams from August 10th and then nationwide from August 20th.",
